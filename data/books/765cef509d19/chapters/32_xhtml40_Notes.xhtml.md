IN THIS SECTION, I have included a detailed list of notes, references, and citations for each chapter in the book. I trust that most readers will find this list to be sufficient. However, I also realize that scientific literature changes over time and the references for this book may need to be updated. Furthermore, I fully expect that I have made a mistake somewhere in this book—either in attributing an idea to the wrong person or not giving credit to someone where it is due. (If you believe this to be the case, please email me at james@jamesclear.com so I can fix the issue as soon as possible.)


In addition to the notes below, you can find a full list of updated endnotes and corrections at atomichabits.com/endnotes.


INTRODUCTION


**We all deal with setbacks****:**What about luck, you might ask? Luck matters, certainly. Habits are not the only thing that influence your success, but they are probably the most important factor that is within your control. And the only self-improvement strategy that makes any sense is to focus on what you can control.

**Just five years after Brailsford took over****:** Technically, the British riders won 57 percent of the road and track cycling medals at the 2008 Olympics. Fourteen gold medals were available in road and track cycling events. The Brits won eight of them.


**the Brits raised the bar****:** “World and Olympic Records Set at the 2012 Summer Olympics,” Wikipedia, December 8, 2017, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_and_Olympic_records_set_at_the_2012_Summer_Olympics#Cycling.

**you’ll end up thirty-seven times better****:**Jason Shen, an entrepreneur and writer, received an early look at this book. After reading this chapter, he remarked: “If the gains were linear, you’d predict to be 3.65x better off. But because it is exponential, the improvement is actually 10x greater.” April 3, 2018.


**Habits are the compound interest****:**Many people have noted how habits multiply over time. Here are some of my favorite articles and books on the subject: Leo Babauta, “The Power of Habit Investments,” Zen Habits, January 28, 2013, https://zenhabits.net/bank; Morgan Housel, “The Freakishly Strong Base,” Collaborative Fund, October 31, 2017, http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/the-freakishly-strong-base; Darren Hardy, *The Compound Effect* (New York: Vanguard Press, 2012).


**Accomplishing one extra task****:**As Sam Altman says, “A small productivity gain, compounded over 50 years, is worth a lot.” “Productivity,” Sam Altman. April 10, 2018, http://blog.samaltman.com/productivity.


**Habits are a double-edged sword****:**I’d like to credit Jason Hreha with originally describing habits to me in this way. Jason Hreha (@jhreha), “They’re a double edged sword,” Twitter, February 21, 2018, https://twitter.com/jhreha/status/966430907371433984.


**The more tasks you can handle without thinking****:** Michael (@mmay3r), “The foundation of productivity is habits. The more you do automatically, the more you’re subsequently freed to do. This effect compounds,” Twitter, April 10, 2018, https://twitter.com/mmay3r/status/983837519274889216.


**each book you read not only teaches****:** This idea—that learning new ideas increases the value of your old ideas—is something I first heard about from Patrick O’Shaughnessy, who writes, “This is why knowledge compounds. Old stuff that was a 4/10 in value can become a 10/10, unlocked by another book in the future.” http://investorfieldguide.com/reading-tweet-storm.


**Cancer spends 80 percent of its life undetectable****:** “How to Live a Longer, Higher Quality Life, with Peter Attia, M.D.,” Investor’s Field Guide, March 7, 2017, http://investorfieldguide.com/attia.


**The San Antonio Spurs****:**Matt Moore, “NBA Finals: A Rock, Hammer and Cracking of Spurs’ Majesty in Game 7,” CBS Sports, June 21, 2013, https://www.cbssports.com/nba/news/nba-finals-a-rock-hammer-and-cracking-of-spurs-majesty-in-game-7.


Inspiration for this drawing came from a tweet titled “Deception of linear vs exponential” by @MlichaelW. May 19, 2018. https://twitter.com/MlichaelW/status/997878086132817920.


**The seed of every habit****:** This paragraph was inspired by a quote from Mr. Mircea, an account on Twitter, who wrote, “each habit began its life as a single decision.” https://twitter.com/mistermircea.


**the goal cannot be what differentiates the winners from the losers****:** Hat tip to CrossFit coach Ben Bergeron for inspiring this quote during a conversation I had with him on February 28, 2017.


**You fall to the level of your systems****:** This line was inspired by the following quote from Archilochus: “We don’t rise to the level of our expectations, we fall to the level of our training.”


CHAPTER 2


**You can imagine them like the layers of an onion****:** Hat tip to Simon Sinek. His “Golden Circle” framework is similar in design, but discusses different topics. For more, see Simon Sinek, *Start with Why: How Great Leaders Inspire Everyone to Take Action* (London: Portfolio/Penguin, 2013), 37.


**I resolved to stop chewing my nails****:** The quotes used in this section are presented as a conversation for reading clarity, but were originally written by Clark. See: Brian Clark, “The Powerful Psychological Boost that Helps You Make and Break Habits,” Further, November 14, 2017, https://further.net/pride-habits.


**Research has shown that once a person****:**Christopher J. Bryan et al., “Motivating Voter Turnout by Invoking the Self,” *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* 108, no. 31 (2011): 12653–12656.


**There is internal pressure****:**Leon Festinger, *A Theory of Cognitive Dissonance* (Stanford, CA: Stanford University Press, 1957).


**Your identity is literally your “repeated beingness”****:** Technically, *identidem* is a word belonging to the Late Latin language. Also, thanks to Tamar Shippony, a reader of jamesclear.com, who originally told me about the etymology of the word *identity*, which she looked up in the American Heritage Dictionary.


**We change bit by bit****:** This is another reason atomic habits are such an effective form of change. If you change your identity too quickly and become someone radically different overnight, then you feel as if you lose your sense of self. But if you update and expand your identity gradually, you will find yourself reborn into someone totally new and yet still familiar. Slowly—habit by habit, vote by vote—you become accustomed to your new identity. Atomic habits and gradual improvement are the keys to identity change without identity loss.


CHAPTER 3


**Edward Thorndike conducted an experiment****:**Peter Gray, *Psychology*, 6th ed. (New York: Worth, 2011), 108–109.


**“by some simple act, such as pulling at a loop of cord”****:** Edward L. Thorndike, “Animal Intelligence: An Experimental Study of the Associative Processes in Animals,” *Psychological Review: Monograph Supplements* 2, no. 4 (1898), doi:10.1037/h0092987.


**“behaviors followed by satisfying consequences”****:** This is an abbreviated version of the original quote from Thorndike, which reads: “responses that produce a satisfying effect in a particular situation become more likely to occur again in that situation, and responses that produce a discomforting effect become less likely to occur again in that situation.” For more, see Peter Gray, *Psychology*, 6th ed. (New York: Worth, 2011), 108–109.

**the conscious mind is the bottleneck****:**William H. Gladstones, Michael A. Regan, and Robert B. Lee, “Division of Attention: The Single-Channel Hypothesis Revisited,” *Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology Section A* 41, no. 1 (1989), doi:10.1080/14640748908402350.

CHAPTER 4


**The psychologist Gary Klein****:**I originally heard about this story from Daniel Kahneman, but it was confirmed by Gary Klein in an email on March 30, 2017. Klein also covers the story in his own book, which uses slightly different quotes: Gary A. Klein, *Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions* (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1998), 43–44.


**military analysts can identify which blip on a radar screen****:**Gary A. Klein, *Sources of Power: How People Make Decisions* (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1998), 38–40.


**Museum curators have been known to discern****:**The story of the Getty kouros, covered in Malcolm Gladwell’s book *Blink*, is a famous example. The sculpture, initially believed to be from ancient Greece, was purchased for $10 million. The controversy surrounding the sculpture happened later when one expert identified it as a forgery upon first glance.


**Experienced radiologists can look at a brain scan****:** Siddhartha Mukherjee, “The Algorithm Will See You Now,” *New Yorker*, April 3, 2017, https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/04/03/ai-versus-md.


**The human brain is a prediction machine****:** The German physician Hermann von Helmholtz developed the idea of the brain being a “prediction machine.”

**she kept asking coworkers if they had washed their hands****:** SwordOfTheLlama, “What Strange Habits Have You Picked Up from Your Line of Work,” Reddit, January 4, 2016, https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3zckq6/what_strange_habits_have_you_picked_up_from_your/cyl3nta.


**story of a man who had spent years working as a lifeguard****:**SwearImaChick, “What Strange Habits Have You Picked Up from Your Line of Work,” Reddit, January 4, 2016, https://www.reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/3zckq6/what_strange_habits_have_you_picked_up_from_your/cyl681q.


**“Until you make the unconscious conscious”****:** Although this quote by Jung is popular, I had trouble tracking down the original source. It’s probably a paraphrase of this passage: “The psychological rule says that when an inner situation is not made conscious, it happens outside, as fate. That is to say, when the individual remains undivided and does not become conscious of his inner opposite, the world must perforce act out the conflict and be torn into opposing halves.” For more, see C. G. Jung, *Aion: Researches into the Phenomenology of the Self* (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1959), 71.


**Pointing-and-Calling reduces errors****:** Alice Gordenker, “JR Gestures,” *Japan Times*, October 21, 2008, https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2008/10/21/reference/jr-gestures/#.WvIG49Mvzu1.


**The MTA subway system in New York City****:**Allan Richarz, “Why Japan’s Rail Workers Can’t Stop Pointing at Things,” *Atlas Obscura*, March 29, 2017, https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/pointing-and-calling-japan-trains.


CHAPTER 5


**researchers in Great Britain began working****:** Sarah Milne, Sheina Orbell, and Paschal Sheeran, “Combining Motivational and Volitional Interventions to Promote Exercise Participation: Protection Motivation Theory and Implementation Intentions,” *British Journal of Health Psychology* 7 (May 2002): 163–184.


**implementation intentions are effective****:** Peter Gollwitzer and Paschal Sheeran, “Implementation Intentions and Goal Achievement: A Meta‐Analysis of Effects and Processes,” *Advances in Experimental Social Psychology* 38 (2006): 69–119.


**writing down the exact time and date of when you will get a flu shot****:** Katherine L. Milkman, John Beshears, James J. Choi, David Laibson, and Brigitte C. Madrian, “Using Implementation Intentions Prompts to Enhance Influenza Vaccination Rates,” *Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences* 108, no. 26 (June 2011): 10415–10420.


**recording the time of your colonoscopy appointment****:** Katherine L. Milkman, John Beshears, James J. Choi, David Laibson, and Brigitte C. Madrian, “Planning Prompts as a Means of Increasing Preventive Screening Rates,” *Preventive Medicine* 56, no. 1 (January 2013): 92–93.


**voter turnout increases****:** David W. Nickerson and Todd Rogers, “Do You Have a Voting Plan? Implementation Intentions, Voter Turnout, and Organic Plan Making,” *Psychological Science* 21, no. 2 (2010): 194–199.


**Other successful government programs****:**“Policymakers around the World Are Embracing Behavioural Science,” *The Economist*, May 18, 2017, https://www.economist.com/news/international/21722163-experimental-iterative-data-driven-approach-gaining-ground-policymakers-around.


**people who make a specific plan for when and where****:**Edwin Locke and Gary Latham, “Building a Practically Useful Theory of Goal Setting and Task Motivation: A 35-Year Odyssey,” *American Psychologist* 57, no. 9 (2002): 705–717, doi:10.1037//0003–066x.57.9.705.


**hope is usually higher****:** Hengchen Dai, Katherine L. Milkman, and Jason Riis, “The Fresh Start Effect: Temporal Landmarks Motivate Aspirational Behavior,” *PsycEXTRA Dataset*, 2014, doi:10.1037/e513702014–058.


**writer Jason Zweig noted****:**Jason Zweig, “Elevate Your Financial IQ: A Value Packed Discussion with Jason Zweig,” interview by Shane Parrish, *The Knowledge Project*, Farnam Street, audio, https://www.fs.blog/2015/10/jason-zweig-knowledge-project.


**many ways to use implementation intentions****:**For the term *habit stacking*, I am indebted to S. J. Scott, who wrote a book by the same name. From what I understand, his concept is slightly different, but I like the term and thought it appropriate to use in this chapter. Previous writers such as Courtney Carver and Julien Smith have also used the term *habit stacking*, but in different contexts.


**The French philosopher Denis Diderot****:**“Denis Diderot,” *New World Encyclopedia*, http://www.newworldencyclopedia.org/entry/Denis_Diderot, last modified October 26, 2017.


**acquired a scarlet robe****:** *Encyclopædia Britannica*, vol. 8 (1911), s.v. “Denis Diderot.” Diderot’s scarlet robe is frequently described as a gift from a friend. However, I could find no original source claiming it was a gift nor any mention of the friend who supplied the robe. If you happen to know any historians specializing in robe acquisitions, feel free to point them my way so we can clarify the mystery of the source of Diderot’s famous scarlet robe.


**“no more coordination, no more unity, no more beauty”****:** Denis Diderot, “Regrets for My Old Dressing Gown,” trans. Mitchell Abidor, 2005, https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/diderot/1769/regrets.htm.


**The Diderot Effect states****:**Juliet Schor, *The Overspent American: Why We Want What We Don’t Need* (New York: HarperPerennial, 1999).


**which was created by BJ Fogg****:** In this chapter, I used the term *habit stacking* to refer to linking a new habit to an old one. For this idea, I give credit to BJ Fogg. In his work, Fogg uses the term *anchoring* to describe this approach because your old habit acts as an “anchor” that keeps the new one in place. No matter what term you prefer, I believe it is a very effective strategy. You can learn more about Fogg’s work and his Tiny Habits Method at https://www.tinyhabits.com.


**“One in, one out”****:** Dev Basu (@devbasu), “Have a one-in-one-out policy when buying things,” Twitter, February 11, 2018, https://twitter.com/devbasu/status/962778141965000704.


CHAPTER 6


**Anne Thorndike****:**Anne N. Thorndike et al., “A 2-Phase Labeling and Choice Architecture Intervention to Improve Healthy Food and Beverage Choices,” *American Journal of Public Health* 102, no. 3 (2012), doi:10.2105/ajph.2011.300391.


**choose products not because of**what**they are****:**Multiple research studies have shown that the mere sight of food can make us feel hungry even when we don’t have actual physiological hunger. According to one researcher, “dietary behaviors are, in large part, the consequence of automatic responses to contextual food cues.” For more, see D. A. Cohen and S. H. Babey, “Contextual Influences on Eating Behaviours: Heuristic Processing and Dietary Choices,” *Obesity Reviews* 13, no. 9 (2012), doi:10.1111/j.1467–789x.2012.01001.x; and Andrew J. Hill, Lynn D. Magson, and John E. Blundell, “Hunger and Palatability: Tracking Ratings of Subjective Experience Before, during and after the Consumption of Preferred and Less Preferred Food,” *Appetite* 5, no. 4 (1984), doi:10.1016/s0195–6663(84)80008–2.


**Behavior is a function of the Person in their Environment****:**Kurt Lewin, *Principles of Topological Psychology* (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1936).


Suggestion Impulse Buying**:**Hawkins Stern, “The Significance of Impulse Buying Today,” *Journal of Marketing* 26, no. 2 (1962), doi:10.2307/1248439.


**45 percent of Coca-Cola sales****:** Michael Moss, “Nudged to the Produce Aisle by a Look in the Mirror,” *New York Times,*August 27, 2013, https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/dining/wooing-us-down-the-produce-aisle.html?_r=0.


**People drink Bud Light because****:** The more exposure people have to food, the more likely they are to purchase it and eat it. T. Burgoine et al., “Associations between Exposure to Takeaway Food Outlets, Takeaway Food Consumption, and Body Weight in Cambridgeshire, UK: Population Based, Cross Sectional Study,” *British Medical Journal* 348, no. 5 (2014), doi:10.1136/bmj.g1464.


**The human body has about eleven million sensory receptors****:**Timothy D. Wilson, *Strangers to Ourselves: Discovering the Adaptive Unconscious* (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press, 2004), 24.


**half of the brain’s resources are used on vision****:** B. R. Sheth et al., “Orientation Maps of Subjective Contours in Visual Cortex,” *Science* 274, no. 5295 (1996), doi:10.1126/science.274.5295.2110.


**When their energy use was obvious and easy to track****:**This story was told to Donella Meadows at a conference in Kollekolle, Denmark, in 1973. For more, see Donella Meadows and Diana Wright, *Thinking in Systems: A Primer* (White River Junction, VT: Chelsea Green, 2015), 109.


**the stickers cut bathroom cleaning costs****:** The actual estimate was 8 percent, but given the variables used, anywhere between 5 percent and 10 percent savings annually is a reasonable guess. Blake Evans-Pritchard, “Aiming to Reduce Cleaning Costs,” *Works That Work*, Winter 2013, https://worksthatwork.com/1/urinal-fly.


**sleeping . . . was the only action that happened in that room****:** “Techniques involving stimulus control have even been successfully used to help people with insomnia. In short, those who had trouble falling asleep were told to only go to their room and lie in their bed when they were tired. If they couldn’t fall asleep, they were told to get up and change rooms. Strange advice, but over time, researchers found that by associating the bed with ‘It’s time to go to sleep’ and not with other activities (reading a book, just lying there, etc.), participants were eventually able to quickly fall asleep due to the repeated process: it became almost automatic to fall asleep in their bed because a successful trigger had been created.” For more, see Charles M. Morin et al., “Psychological and Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia: Update of the Recent Evidence (1998–2004),” *Sleep* 29, no. 11 (2006), doi:10.1093/sleep/29.11.1398; and Gregory Ciotti, “The Best Way to Change Your Habits? Control Your Environment,” Sparring Mind, https://www.sparringmind.com/changing-habits.


**habits can be easier to change in a new environment****:** S. Thompson, J. Michaelson, S. Abdallah, V. Johnson, D. Morris, K. Riley, and A. Simms, ‘*Moments of Change’ as Opportunities for Influencing Behaviour: A Report to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs* (London: Defra, 2011), http://randd.defra.gov.uk/Document.aspx?Document=MomentsofChangeEV0506FinalReport Nov2011(2).pdf.


**when you step outside your normal environment****:**Various research studies have found that it is easier to change your behavior when your environment changes. For example, students change their television watching habits when they transfer schools. Wendy Wood and David T. Neal, “Healthy through Habit: Interventions for Initiating and Maintaining Health Behavior Change,” *Behavioral Science and Policy* 2, no. 1 (2016), doi:10.1353/bsp.2016.0008; W. Wood, L. Tam, and M. G. Witt, “Changing Circumstances, Disrupting Habits,” *Journal of Personality and Social Psychology* 88, no. 6 (2005), doi:10.1037/0022–3514.88.6.918


**You aren’t battling old environmental cues****:** Perhaps this is why 36 percent of successful changes in behavior were associated with a move to a new place. Melissa Guerrero-Witt, Wendy Wood, and Leona Tam, “Changing Circumstances, Disrupting Habits,” *PsycEXTRA Dataset* 88, no. 6 (2005), doi:10.1037/e529412014–144.

**It’s easier to practice self-restraint when you don’t have to use it****:** “Our prototypical model of self-control is angel on one side and devil on the other, and they battle it out. . . . We tend to think of people with strong willpower as people who are able to fight this battle effectively. Actually, the people who are really good at self-control never have these battles in the first place.” For more, see Brian Resnick, “The Myth of Self-Control,” *Vox*, November 24, 2016, https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2016/11/3/13486940/self-control-psychology-myth.


**A habit that has been encoded in the mind is ready to be used****:** Wendy Wood and Dennis Rünger, “Psychology of Habit,” *Annual Review of Psychology* 67, no. 1 (2016), doi:10.1146/annurev-psych-122414–033417.

**The importance of dopamine****:**“The importance of dopamine was discovered by accident. In 1954, James Olds and Peter Milner, two neuroscientists at McGill University, decided to implant an electrode deep into the center of a rat’s brain. The precise placement of the electrode was largely happenstance; at the time, the geography of the mind remained a mystery. But Olds and Milner got lucky. They inserted the needle right next to the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), a part of the brain that generates pleasurable feelings. Whenever you eat a piece of chocolate cake, or listen to a favorite pop song, or watch your favorite team win the World Series, it is your NAcc that helps you feel so happy. But Olds and Milner quickly discovered that too much pleasure can be fatal. They placed the electrodes in several rodents’ brains and then ran a small current into each wire, making the NAccs continually excited. The scientists noticed that the rodents lost interest in everything. They stopped eating and drinking. All courtship behavior ceased. The rats would just huddle in the corners of their cages, transfixed by their bliss. Within days, all of the animals had perished. They died of thirst.

Nearly 75 percent of subjects made the incorrect choice at least once. However, considering the total number of responses throughout the experiment, about two thirds were correct. Either way, the point stands: group pressure can significantly alter our ability to make accurate decisions.

CHAPTER 11


**In the end, they had little to show for their efforts****:** This story comes from page 29 of *Art & Fear* by David Bayles and Ted Orland. In an email conversation with Orland on October 18, 2016, he explained the origins of the story. “Yes, the ‘ceramics story’ in ‘Art & Fear’ is indeed true, allowing for some literary license in the retelling. Its real-world origin was as a gambit employed by photographer Jerry Uelsmann to motivate his Beginning Photography students at the University of Florida. As retold in ‘Art & Fear’ it faithfully captures the scene as Jerry told it to me—except I replaced photography with ceramics as the medium being explored. Admittedly, it would’ve been easier to retain photography as the art medium being discussed, but David Bayles (co-author) & I are both photographers ourselves, and at the time we were consciously trying to broaden the range of media being referenced in the text. The intriguing thing to me is that it hardly matters what art form was invoked—the moral of the story appears to hold equally true straight across the whole art spectrum (and even outside the arts, for that matter).” Later in that same email, Orland said, “You have our permission to reprint any or all of the ‘ceramics’ passage in your forthcoming book.” In the end, I settled on publishing an adapted version, which combines their telling of the ceramics story with facts from the original source of Uelsmann’s photography students.

**Future You****:**Hat tip to behavioral economist Daniel Goldstein, who said, “It’s an unequal battle between the present self and the future self. I mean, let’s face it, the present self is present. It’s in control. It’s in power right now. It has these strong, heroic arms that can lift doughnuts into your mouth. And the future self is not even around. It’s off in the future. It’s weak. It doesn’t even have a lawyer present. There’s nobody to stick up for the future self. And so the present self can trounce all over its dreams.” For more, see Daniel Goldstein, “The Battle between Your Present and Future Self,” TEDSalon NY2011, November 2011, video, https://www.ted.com/talks/daniel_goldstein_the_battle_between_your_present_and_future_self.

**The most effective form of motivation is progress****:**This line is paraphrased from Greg McKeown, who wrote, “Research has shown that of all forms of human motivation the most effective one is progress.” Greg McKeown, *Essentialism: The Disciplined Pursuit of Less* (Currency, 2014).


**The first mistake is never the one that ruins you****:** In fact, research has shown that missing a habit once has virtually no impact on the odds of developing a habit over the long-term, regardless of when the mistake occurs. As long as you get back on track, you’re fine. See: Phillippa Lally et al., “How Are Habits Formed: Modelling Habit Formation in the Real World,” *European Journal of Social Psychology* 40, no. 6 (2009), doi:10.1002/ejsp.674.


**Missing once is an accident****:** “Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit.” I swear I read this line somewhere or perhaps paraphrased it from something similar, but despite my best efforts all of my searches for a source are coming up empty. Maybe I came up with it, but my best guess is it belongs to an unidentified genius instead.


**“When a measure becomes a target”****:** This definition of Goodhart’s Law was actually formulated by the British anthropologist Marilyn Strathern. “‘Improving Ratings’: Audit in the British University System,” *European Review* 5 (1997): 305–321, https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-review/article/improving-ratings-audit-in-the-british-university-system/FC2EE640C0C44E3DB87C29FB666E9AAB. Goodhart himself reportedly advanced the idea sometime around 1975 and put it formally into writing in 1981. Charles Goodhart, “Problems of Monetary Management: The U.K. Experience,” in Anthony S. Courakis (ed.), *Inflation, Depression, and Economic Policy in the West* (London: Rowman and Littlefield, 1981), 111–146.

Genes have been shown to influence everything: “All traits are heritable” is a bit of an exaggeration, but not by much. Concrete behavioral traits that patently depend on content provided by the home or culture are, of course, not heritable at all; which language you speak, which religion you worship in, which political party you belong to. But behavioral traits that reflect the underlying talents and temperaments are heritable: how proficient with language you are, how religious, how liberal or conservative. General intelligence is heritable, and so are the five major ways in which personality can vary . . . openness to experience, conscientiousness, extroversion-introversion, antagonism-agreeableness, and neuroticism. And traits that are surprisingly specific turn out to be heritable, too, such as dependence on nicotine or alcohol, number of hours of television watched, and likelihood of divorcing. Thomas J. Bouchard, “Genetic Influence on Human Psychological Traits,” *Current Directions in Psychological Science* 13, no. 4 (2004), doi:10.1111/j.0963–7214.2004.00295.x; Robert Plomin, *Nature and Nurture: An Introduction to Human Behavioral Genetics* (Stamford, CT: Wadsworth, 1996); Robert Plomin, “Why We’re Different,” Edge, June 29, 2016, https://soundcloud.com/edgefoundationinc/edge2016-robert-plomin.

LITTLE LESSONS FROM THE FOUR LAWS


“Happiness is the space between one desire”**:** Caed (@caedbudris), “Happiness is the space between desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming,” Twitter, November 10, 2017, https://twitter.com/caedbudris/status/929042389930594304.


happiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue**:** Frankl’s full quotation is as follows: “Don’t aim at success. The more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side effect of one’s personal dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as the by-product of one’s surrender to a person other than oneself.” For more, see Viktor E. Frankl, *Man’s Search for Meaning: An Introduction to Logotherapy* (Boston: Beacon Press, 1962).


“He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how”: Friedrich Nietzsche and Oscar Levy, *The Twilight of the Idols* (Edinburgh: Foulis, 1909).


The feeling comes first (System 1): Daniel Kahneman, *Thinking, Fast and Slow* (New York: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2015).


appealing to emotion is typically more powerful than appealing to reason: “If you wish to persuade, appeal to interest, rather than reason” (Benjamin Franklin).


Satisfaction = Liking − Wanting: This is similar to David Meister’s fifth law of service businesses: Satisfaction = perception − expectation.


“Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more”: Lucius Annaeus Seneca and Anna Lydia Motto, *Moral Epistles* (Chico, CA: Scholars Press, 1985).


As Aristotle noted: It is debated whether Aristotle actually said this. The quote has been attributed to him for centuries, but I could find no primary source for the phrase.

* The terms *unconscious*, *nonconscious*, and *subconscious* can all be used to describe the absence of awareness or thought. Even in academic circles, these words are often used interchangeably without much nitpicking (for once). *Nonconscious* is the term I’m going to use because it is broad enough to encompass both the processes of the mind we could never consciously access and the moments when we are simply not paying attention to what surrounds us. *Nonconscious* is a description of anything you are not consciously thinking about.

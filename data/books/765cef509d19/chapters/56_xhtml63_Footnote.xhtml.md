* This is also referred to as a “Ulysses pact” or a “Ulysses contract.” Named after Ulysses, the hero of *The Odyssey*, who told his sailors to tie him to the mast of the ship so that he could hear the enchanting song of the Sirens but wouldn’t be able to steer the ship toward them and crash on the rocks. Ulysses realized the benefits of locking in your future actions while your mind is in the right place rather than waiting to see where your desires take you in the moment.

      },
      {
        "speaker": "Jamie",
        "text": "That's part of it, yeah. But at its core, copyright is a legal right granted to the creator of original works, including literary, dramatic, musical, and certain other intellectual works. It basically gives the creator exclusive rights to control how their work is used."

        "speaker": "Alex",

      {
        "speaker": "Jamie",
        "text": "That's a fair question. Imagine you spend years writing a book. Without copyright, someone could just copy it, sell it as their own, and you'd get nothing. No incentive to create anything new, right?"
      },
      {
        "speaker": "Alex",

        "speaker": "Jamie",
        "text": "Great question! Fair use allows for certain limited uses of copyrighted material without permission, such as criticism, commentary, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research. It's a bit of a gray area, but the key is that it shouldn't significantly harm the market for the original work."
      },

        "speaker": "Jamie",

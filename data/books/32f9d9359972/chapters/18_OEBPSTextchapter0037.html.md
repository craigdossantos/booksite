## Acknowledgments


 


I would like to express my gratitude to the many people who saw me through this process—to all those who provided support, talked things over, read, wrote, offered comments, allowed me to quote their remarks, and assisted in the editing, proofreading, and design.


First and foremost, thank you to my beautiful wife, Nichole, for standing beside me throughout my career. You supported and encouraged me in spite of the frequency with which it took me away from you and the girls at the least convenient times. You put everything on hold for me while I played cop and never batted an eye, even though I gave you every reason to. Your patience with me never wavered as I transitioned into this latest endeavor. What you have done and who you are to me I could never adequately express.


My loving daughters, Morgan and Taylor. Quia amor, auxilium, et solatium habeamus constant. You have always been my biggest cheerleaders, making me feel bigger and better than I am. I am so proud of the ladies you have become.


To my wonderful mom, Linda: without your support, this would not have happened. As a single mother, you probably never would have imagined that your knuckle-headed son would become an author. Because of what you taught me and what you espoused as I grew, look at me now!


Special thanks to Chris Voss, my mentor, my friend, my boss. You saw something in me that few others have over the course of my career. Your confidence in my ability and potential was a direct contributor to this book. It would be impossible for me to count all the ways you have helped me in both my first and second careers. Consider me eternally grateful.


Professor Eric Koester, for inspiring me to publish this book. There were many times during the process when I questioned my worth, my writing, my (as it appeared at the time) waste of time. Through it all you continued to push and encourage. I have not been coached like that since high school. That and all the other ancillary things you and your staff did made this possible. Because of you I can legitimately hang the word “author” at the end of my name. How cool is that? Thank you.


Robyn Nichols. You and I both know you could have easily written this. You taught me more about what a leader should be than anyone else I have ever worked for, not because you preached it but because you modeled it. I have always said if I became just half the leader you are, I would be okay. Thank you for your belief in me when I was your boss. When you were mine. When we worked side by side. People often ask what I miss most about not being “on the job.” It is working with you.


Marcela Oakley for nagging, nagging, nagging me to write this. As I think back on it, you probably gave me the final push. You are a true student of the game, a consummate professional, and a great friend.


I would be remiss if I did not give a tip of the cap to all of the exceptional negotiators who came before me. You cut the path and made it easier for guys like me.


Last but not least, all of you whom I have worked with, around, and for over the course of my time on this planet whose names I have failed to mention: you all had a hand in this. Thank you for teaching me.

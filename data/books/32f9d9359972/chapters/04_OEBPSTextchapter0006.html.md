## The Crisis of Leadership and the Hostage Negotiator Framework


 


### The Crisis: Ego and Authority


 


We have all experienced bad leadership. Whether we have been the recipient or the one responsible, we know that misuse of authority produces pain and disappointment.


What research shows again and again is that ego and authority are the mother and father of toxic leadership. They instill fear. They influence the actions of coworkers and employees creating anger, resentment, mistrust, and hostility. When these characteristics become a part of an organization’s culture, quality of life and retention rates plummet.


Abraham Lincoln once said, “If you want to discover just what there is in a man—give him power. It will either make him or wreck him.”


The Hostage Negotiator Leadership (HNL) framework is designed to make us better, by understanding that ego and authority are not 100 percent evil. The lack of understanding and the absence of self-control are what wrecks us and those we lead. The highest-performing organizations have exceptional leaders who have figured out how to cultivate emotional intelligence (EQ) and what I call Tactical Empathy to get the best from their teams. This book explains how.


It also serves as a contrast to much of what has been said about EQ up to this point. If you search Google for the terms “business leaders and EQ,” you will find a trove of articles, books, and blog posts, with new material emerging every day to advocate for the importance of EQ in leadership. But very few of them give you the skills necessary to improve your EQ or enhance your ability to demonstrate empathy.


The goal I want to work toward is for you to become a better leader by improving your interpersonal communications and EQ by using the HNL framework that relies on the following principles:


 


• Focusing on the process, not the objective. Navigate the conversation, zeroing in what is being said and why as opposed to focusing on the end result.


 


• Understanding the importance of sequencing. The proper sequencing is Tactical Empathy first, your objective last.


 


• Gathering information. Navigating tough conversations is an exercise in guided discovery where you actively seek new information about your counterpart.


 


• Demonstrating Tactical Empathy. Show your counterpart that you understand the way they view the circumstances.


 


• Understanding the human-nature response. Negative emotions and dynamics are significant drivers of human decision-making and behavior.


 


• Creating safe and inclusive environments. Establish a workplace environment free of unnecessary commentary where input is encouraged.


 


• Using tone, delivery, and projected sincerity. How you say it is much more important than what you say.


 


HNL has many moving parts, so it is critical for you to be cognizant of the various factors that impact your effectiveness in improving your relationships with colleagues and the people who work for you. First and foremost, it is hard work!


 


### Tough Conversations


 


No one really likes to engage in tough conversations. If you close your eyes right now and think about a real or imagined difficult conversation, it is probably not a pleasant thought. You will likely conjure up an image of a snarling, aggressive, crying, hysterical, or manipulative counterpart who tries to impose their will or otherwise paint you into a corner.


Tough conversations create stress. Stress constricts thinking and makes us uncomfortable. When we are uncomfortable, we want more than anything to be comfortable again—as quickly as possible. The sooner you solve the problem, the sooner the tough conversation will be over. The sooner the tough conversation is over, the sooner you can get out of the room. The sooner you can get out of the room, the sooner your comfort level returns. This “sequencing” causes leaders to compromise their position, violate rules, or deviate from best practices.


I like to drive this point home with a short negotiation exercise called sixty seconds that I often use with corporate training groups. I ask for three volunteers and move them outside the main room. Then I explain to the non-volunteers what is about to happen.


For the purpose of this exercise, I am a bank robber. I have no other gainful employment. When I want to put food on the table or clothes on my back or buy some of the finer things in life, I rob banks. And I am good—except today I got caught, and now I am trapped inside the bank.


The volunteers, who play the role of the hostage negotiator, do not know how many accomplices I have. They do not know how many hostages there are, and they are not permitted to negotiate about the following items:


 


• Drugs or alcohol


 


• Weapons and ammunition


 


• Transportation


 


• Exchange of hostages


 


These items are prohibited by almost every law enforcement agency in the country.


I then bring the volunteers back into the room and give them the ground rules. Once they have gotten themselves together, I have them “ring” the phone, and the exercise begins.


I answer and say, “I want a car in sixty seconds or she dies,” in an aggressive tone. Most stammer a response, ask me my name, or deny the request and then immediately switch to bargaining with me (i.e., problem-solving).


 


Them: Uh…can I have your name?


 


Me: You do not need to know my name! You now have fifty seconds! (The stress created by my elevated voice and tone becomes apparent.)


 


Them: (Sigh) Shit. What kind of car do you want? What type of transportation do you need? (One of the four things that I explicitly told them they could not bring up. Stress.)


 


Me: I will let you make the determination on that. Two-door. Four-door. It does not matter to me. I just want you to pull it up out front, leave the keys in the ignition, and leave the driver’s door open.


 


Them: How many people are gonna be in the car? I need to know.


 


Me: It is just gonna be me. I am coming out by myself.


 


Them: By yourself? (Great Mirror)


 


Me: By myself. How long is it gonna take? You have got forty seconds!


 


Them: Where are you going?


 


Me: I am not gonna divulge where I am going. Just know that I am leaving here. You have thirty seconds!


 


Them: Is there anything else you need?


 


Me: I did not ask for anything else! I asked you for a car! You have got twenty-five seconds!


 


Them: Okay. We are working on it.


 


Me: All right. Let’s do it. What are you gonna do? You gonna call me back?


 


Them: Well, I am gonna see if I can find you a car.


 


Me: Are you serious? There are fifty of you out there. I am confident that one of you dummies drove here today! Get me that car!


 


Them: (Under their breath) I think I had better find a car. (To me) Okay. We are working on it. We are gonna pull it up right out front, and you are gonna come out the front door? What else do you need? What else do you need to feel comfortable...to end this situation? You are just gonna—you are just gonna drive the car away? All by yourself?


 


Me: You let me know when it is my time to talk.


 


Them: What is that?


 


Me: You let me know when it is my turn to talk. You are dominating the conversation.


 


Them: I am just asking you what you need to make you feel comfortable. I—


 


Me: Can I talk?


 


Them: Sure. Absolutely.


 


Me: I do not need anything else. I did not ask you for anything else. I just want the car. You said you were gonna pull it up out front. I just need to know how long it is gonna take because I need to get ready.


 


Them: We can do it in a few minutes.


 


Me: A few minutes? Great. Just let me know when it is there, and I will walk out. You have my word.


 


Them: Okay. We have the car identified.


 


Me: Okay.


 


Them: Uh…it is coming around front. There is gonna be a police officer there. He is gonna leave the keys in the ignition and leave the door open.


 


The exercise clearly demonstrates that stress and pressure, born out of the emotion of fear, cause the participants to compromise, jump prematurely into problem-solving, and break rules, all so they can get comfortable again. The same dynamics occur in difficult conversations every day.


As a leader, it is common to go into tough conversations driving for a yes with employees, peers, or supervisors. But HNL does not prioritize your yes. That comes later.


Instead, HNL prioritizes the why. What are the underlying motivations and emotions that are driving the behavior of the other person? This requires the use of Tactical Empathy, which is the deliberate attempt to recognize and articulate another’s perspective.


Once you understand Tactical Empathy, at the deepest level, then you are in a position to:


 


• Resolve the issue.


 


• Make your ask.


 


• State your objective.


 


• Satisfy the needs of the other person.


 


Bottom line? It is not about you. It is about them. And it is about discovering their why without asking why.


 


### Self-Control


 


To engage others in significant conversations where emotions run high, keeping your wits about you is crucial to a positive outcome. When confronted with these situations, the first thing to do is control your own emotions and behavior rather than trying to control the emotions and behavior of the other person. If you cannot control yourself, you cannot effectively direct the discussion. If you respond to an attack or to anger with anger, you become part of the problem, not the solution.


Do not confuse getting even with getting what you want. If the conversation is confrontational, work toward de-escalation. Do not punish with words. Focus on the process of satisfying the other person’s needs rather than working toward a predetermined outcome.


A calm, controlled demeanor is usually more effective than a brilliant argument.


 


### Understanding People, Building Relationships


 


To understand people, you have to build and maintain relationships. Leaders often possess four attitudes, which interfere with building and maintaining relationships:


 


• Black-and-white thinking


 


• A belief that feelings are not important


 


• Ability to quickly solve problems


 


• Inflexibility


 


Black-and-white thinking plays into our tendency to look for what is easy to comprehend. Cognitive overload is a pain in the head. At the same time, leaders like to think of themselves as smart. Intellectually, we understand that the world is complex, but we still find ourselves drawn into viewing things as either black or white in an increasingly gray world. Good or evil. Right or wrong. Yes or no.


Black-and-white thinking is not fundamentally bad until it generates a false dichotomy that clouds our vision and judgment. As the adage goes, there are two sides to every story, and then there is the truth.


Feelings are important, which is critical for successful leaders to understand. Like it or not, people make decisions based on how they feel, no matter how left-brained they might be. It is impossible to remove emotions from the decision-making process, so telling employees to ignore theirs or others’ happens at your organization’s peril. Focus your attention on motivation and driving forces to build collaborative teams. Yes, your people need you to have operational awareness, but they also need you to have good interpersonal skills and emotional awareness.


If you can combine rational skills with EQ, you can transform who you are as a leader and increase the satisfaction of the people who work around you.


Quick problem-solving is definitely a useful skill. But sometimes when someone approaches you with a problem, they do not just want your help in solving it. Sometimes they just want you to listen.


As a leader, you are expected to adhere to the organization’s mission and help it grow, which requires a lot of problem-solving. Too often, though, we rush to a particular outcome at the expense of understanding. Think about it. How often does your company actually encourage people to slow down and think? Most do not. How much problem-solving could be accomplished simply by listening to the personnel?


Whether navigating a difficult conversation or making critical decisions, showing restraint and being patient offers the best results. Rushing toward the outcome without listening, focusing on the process, or identifying the why is a recipe for failure.


Inflexibility happens when we come up with a plan of action and refuse to budge. But rigidity is a pacifier for weak or insecure leaders. Inflexible leaders push forward when it would be smarter to adapt or consider the input of others. Rigid leaders relish command and control. It is “my way or the highway.” These leaders confuse compliance with bona fide team ownership or buy-in. As a result, they reject input from highly talented employees because they perceive these employees as threats. Perhaps most damaging of all, rigid leaders do not listen.


Flexible leaders utilize multiple approaches and have the ability to adjust to each team member or situation. They modify their style in accordance with uncertain or unpredictable circumstances and recognize situations in which they do not know it all. Strive to be flexible and creative in your approach to leading your team.


Do not say never. Say, “It depends.”


 


### Listen


 


As I pointed out above, listening is the easiest and most affordable way to find common ground and create a positive atmosphere for problem-solving at the appropriate time. Do not argue. Give people a “hearing,” and allow them to vent. People want to be understood. Listen to them. Acknowledge their points. Acknowledgment does not equate to agreement. Agree whenever you can—without conceding.


Also bear in mind that most people do not always say what they mean. They ask the wrong questions or couch messages within statements. Good listening will help you go beneath the surface to understand what the other person is really trying to say. Your challenge is to listen for underlying emotion or meaning. Part of your responsibility as a leader is to balance the sometimes-extensive list of “demands” made by your employees with the needs of the organization as you come to a resolution or agreement.


It is going to take some work.


Much of the work will be getting your head around the five different levels of listening.


 


1. Intermittent listening is listening long enough to get the gist before refocusing on your internal voice, reactions, and thoughts. This is your frame of reference.


 


2. Listening for rebuttals is listening to their point of view long enough so you can rebut it or until you hear something that triggers a reaction that you can argue with. Then you are just waiting for them to stop talking so you can interject.


 


3. Listening for the internal logic of what they are saying, using a lot of inference, is next. If this is their world-view, conclusion, or judgment—the story they are telling—what is their data? What is the reasoning or interpretation? What is the rationale behind what they are saying? Why does it make sense to them?


 


4. Listening for the emotions and identity issues attached to the argument is the next level. What frustrations, anxiety, despair, or betrayal are driving the argument? They may or may not line up logically for you, but they are certainly a part of what the person is trying to express as they talk about what is important to them.


 


5. Listening for their life’s narrative is the deepest level. How does this match who they are in the world? What meaning do they give it? How do they view the lay of the land? What are their circumstances? What does their message symbolize or represent?


 


We put that filter of recognition on top of emotion and logic. This goes beyond, “Oh yeah, I get where they are coming from” to deeply appreciating their environment and motivations.


If you do not understand their worldview, you do not understand them. If you do not understand them, you cannot influence them. Listening at level five takes effort and energy—too much to operate at it 24/7. Most of us operate at levels two and three most of the day. Your challenge as a leader is to be able to engage at the fifth level when it counts.

## Hostage Negotiator Parenting


 


##### I would there were no age between 16 and three and 20, or that youth would sleep out the rest for there’s nothing in between but getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry, stealing, fighting…


##### —William Shakespeare, The Winter’s Tale


 


Parents of adolescents with serious behavioral problems often feel like hostages. A hostage-taking teenager can ruin their own life and the lives of their parents and siblings. “Difficult” teens are often sent away to expensive “programs,” some of which can run over $100,000.


For many youngsters, the long-term success of these programs is questionable. Impoverished or even middle-class homes cannot afford long-term interventions on this scale. At best they get some counseling or some mind-numbing medications. A few lucky ones end up in a sports program with a great coach as a mentor.


What if there was something else—an actual method of intervention that worked to free teenagers from taking themselves and their parents hostage?


The skills espoused by the Black Swan Group have been tested and proven effective in changing the behavior of difficult adolescents in clinical settings. They will prove likewise in the home before a clinical setting becomes necessary.


It begins with understanding what is going on “upstairs” in the brain.


 


#### The Adolescent Brain


 


The generally accepted belief used to be that the vast majority of brain development took place in the first few years of life. As recently as the late 1990s, we did not have the ability to look inside the human brain and track development. Between then and now, significant advancements in brain imaging technologies have rectified that. With magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), neuroscientists can now look inside the brain and track changes in both structure and function. MRIs take pictures while fMRIs take videos of brain activity, giving us robust representations of how the brain develops. This insight has changed the way scientists think about such development by revealing that the majority of it does not end in early childhood. Instead, the brain continues to develop throughout adolescence and into adulthood.


Adolescence is the transition period between childhood and adulthood. This period of life starts with the biological, hormonal, and physical changes of puberty. It ends when the individual attains stability and independence. During this time, dramatic changes occur in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). This region of the brain is involved in decision-making, planning, and inhibiting inappropriate behavior. It is also involved in self-awareness and understanding social interactions with other people.


MRI studies looking at the development of the PFC have shown that it undergoes dramatic changes during adolescence. The volume of gray matter declines significantly because the brain eliminates unnecessary connections between synapses. The brain gives itself a tune-up.


Scientists have examined brain scans of both adolescents and adults who were tasked with thinking about other people’s mental and emotional states. They found that part of the PFC was more active in adolescents than it was in adults. They also learned that the activity decreased with age. These examinations have been conducted numerous times in labs around the world, and they all show the same thing. The activity in the medial PFC decreases during adolescence; therefore, the ability to consider someone else’s perspective is still developing.


When your teenager displays a reluctance or refusal to consider other perspectives, seems self-absorbed, takes risks, or is moody, it’s because their brain is not ready.


This has implications on how you should navigate tough conversations with your children.


During adolescence, when independence becomes increasingly important, tough conversations are around every corner. When “I want” or “I need” is in your head or your child’s head, you are in a tough conversation.


In every tough conversation, there are negative dynamics and emotions at play. These are exacerbated by the underdeveloped PFC. Even as an adult with a fully functioning PFC, when your negative emotions are high, your rational thinking is low. Negative emotions are responses to real or perceived threats that activate the amygdala, which impedes what is supposed to be going on in the PFC. When you are triggered, you are dumber than you otherwise would be. Imagine how much more impactful those negative emotions and dynamics are for an adolescent.


As parents, we are going to do or say things that cause them to push back. That is just the way it is. How you respond to that pushback is what matters most.


Many parents get so caught up in trying to quash the resistance that they fail to look at what is motivating it.


When kids push back, parents often jump into explanation mode. When you are explaining, you are losing. The dissension will not go away unless you have addressed the negatives that are fueling it.


Be aggressive in your pursuit of understanding what is motivating your child’s behavior. That understanding will enable you to navigate difficult conversations, improving your relationship along the way.


Communication is of the utmost importance in every relationship. This is especially true when it comes to your relationship with family, including adolescents. They are under tremendous pressures from peer or romantic relationships, future plans, or current performance issues, and other sources. They want you to understand what the lay of the land looks like from their perspective. How do you do it? Tactical Empathy.


 


#### Tactical Empathy: The Secret to Hostage Negotiator-Parenting


 


At its core, Hostage Negotiator-Parenting (HNP) is designed to change the way you think about communicating with your teen. It is you using Tactical Empathy and treating them with the same level of deference that hostage negotiators use with hostage-takers. It promotes a healthy home environment and, ultimately, achieves better outcomes.


Using the Black Swan Method, negative outcomes for and offensive behaviors by your teen can be managed or avoided altogether. Your ability to consciously and proactively identify your teen’s perspective and articulate that recognition is key to improving or repairing your relationship.


Note the specific use of the words “articulate” and “recognition.” Recognition of what the world looks like to them is the easy part. Articulation is where most parents falter. Intuitively they recognize what is going on with their child. Their “gut” tells them. According to Dr. Bruce Lipton, author of Biology of Belief, your conscious brain processes forty bits of information per second. Your gut (i.e., your subconscious brain) processes 20 million bits per second. It is you knowing without knowing how you know. Articulating your child’s perspective ensures that they know you see them that way.


Maybe they made a bad choice and are dealing with the consequences or they did or said something that made you angry. Instead of solely looking at the behavior, stay curious, and try to find the motivation for the behavior or statement. If you stay genuinely curious during the conversation, it will be impossible for you to get triggered. Reaction is almost always emotional. Response is almost always rational. If you react negatively, it may discourage them from coming to you with similar issues in the future.


Avoid judgment, criticism, and lecturing. They often know they screwed up. Piling on, even if done out of love or concern, does not help. Label their circumstances or emotions before jumping to conclusions or making assumptions. Lecturing about how you handled similar situations when you were their age is a cheap attempt at common ground and can be counterproductive. Instead of bringing down Thor’s hammer, just listen. Once you have done that, then you can work together toward the next steps.


Just because you should not lecture does not mean that you cannot offer support or advice.


In fact, that is your responsibility. It is just a matter of how you sequence the conversation. It is always Tactical Empathy first and support and advice second. You may simply state, “It seems like you have a vision for how you would like to see this play out.” This is an “asking” Label used in place of, “What do you want to do now?” Teens are guarded by nature. They are suspicious of direct questions and often tell us only what they want us to know. You are more likely to get an unguarded answer when using a Label over a direct question.


The “asking” Label is followed by a No-Oriented Question, such as: “Are you against sharing that vision with me?” The word “vision” is used specifically in this instance because most of us are imaginative people, teens included. The word “vision” turns them into the narrator of the movie that is playing in their head. See how their response meshes with or diverges from the advice you are planning to give. Label, Mirror, or Paraphrase the portions of their response that line up with what you were thinking. The more it lines up, the less you have to say and the more buy-in you are likely to get because it will seem like their solution.


If it diverges, be careful not to offend. As an example, start with another No-Oriented Question, such as: “Are you against me walking you through what I was thinking?” After you receive the response, follow it with an Accusations Audit or three: “This is going to sound harsh. You are going to think I am way off base or trying to impose my will.” Let that sit for a few seconds, and then provide them with your vision of how you think the issue should be resolved. Be ready to be attacked. In every difficult conversation, the chances of being attacked are real. Do not rise to the bait and attack back. Attacking back or other negative emotional reactions will fire up their already activated amygdala and further impede their ability to process. Likewise, you cannot flee—literally or figuratively. Moving off topic or disengaging means the negative dynamic has not been addressed and will return again. Stay in the moment, and figure out where it is coming from. An attack during a difficult conversation means they think you are not listening, you have not identified other pressures they are under, or they are trying to manipulate you. You have to figure out which one.


 


#### What if they refuse to open up?


 


Hit them with an Accusations Audit followed by a Label: “I know this is difficult for you. You probably think I will not understand. You seem incredibly guarded and probably think this is a waste of time.” The silence is them telling you, I do not trust you with this information, for whatever reason. Again, focus on the motivation of the behavior, not the behavior itself. Ask yourself, What are they telling me by not telling me? If they are steadfast in their silence, do not push. Use a Label: “It seems like you are just not ready.” Follow this statement with Dynamic Silence. Sometimes they need a little time and space to process emotions that are hard to convey at their age.


 


#### What if I am the cause of the current situation?


 


If you are (or you think you might be) the cause, apologize. Never underestimate the currency of an apology. Whether you believe you are at fault does not matter. If your kid believes you are at fault, then you are at fault. An apology will ratchet tension down in the home. It is the first step in returning your teen to their normal functioning level and showing them transparency and humility. That it is not about you.


Stay curious, and stay in control of yourself. The only aspect in any tough conversation that you have total control over is your emotions. Shut your mouth. Assume you have something to learn. Trust me: you do. We all hide information during tough conversations. Teens have mastered this. They are in possession of a multitude of Black Swans. The more you talk, the less you are learning. If it is a planned conversation, vent to someone else before engaging your teen. The more you get off your chest before you get into the room, the less will come out when you are in the room. Remember, your teen is not the problem. The issue is the problem.


Prepare to give them a hearing. By default, most adolescents think people (adults) do not understand them, and all of us want to be understood. Listening is the cheapest and most effective concession we can make for our kids with the endgame of showing respect. Focus on the process of navigating the conversation and understanding and satisfying their needs rather than “I am right. You are wrong.”


Show them that you are not trying to walk in their shoes but rather see through their eyes. Try a Summary: “X, Y, and Z occurred, and as a result, you feel…” or “It sounds like that really made you upset.” Being right is not the key; making the attempt to get it right is!


Adolescents are expressive by nature and are frequently hypervigilant, which is just a fancy way of saying they will be more apt to see through your BS. Your tone indicates your attitude and speaks louder than anything you may actually say. A calm, controlled demeanor is more effective than a brilliant argument.


Acknowledge their point and agree whenever you can, but remember agreement is not necessary. This will help to create a positive atmosphere for problem-solving.


Recognize your own culpability. How have you contributed to the current dynamic? What went wrong?


Begin the process of answering these questions with Accusations Audits and an apology. Something like, “I know I offended you. I am sorry,” and “You think I am self-serving, rude, and condescending. You believe I do not appreciate what you are going through.”


Next, invite them to talk using a No-Oriented Question. “Would it be ridiculous if we took a few minutes to clear the air?”


Follow this with a Summary, and then ask, “What am I missing?” Your kids love to point out when you are wrong. If you are missing anything, they will tell you. Listen carefully. If they take the time to correct you, they are sharing something that is important to them.


Next comes the “vision” Label to get to the catalyst of the conflict and what they think the next steps should be. You will Label, Mirror, or Paraphrase the response and follow with another No-Oriented Question, asking permission to share your vision.


 


#### Resolution: Is their agreement or buy-in on solid ground?


 


Once you have agreed on the resolution, use a Summary to cement the agreement. Follow that with a few Calibrated Questions to test commitment to the agreement. “How will we know we are on track? What should we do if we are not?” Labeling and Mirroring the responses will solidify what was agreed upon.


 


#### Remember to be aware of common obstacles to agreement.


 


These can include:


 


• Unsatisfied emotional needs. We cannot direct a person’s decision-making until we deal with the negative emotions as they see them. If you jump into problem-solving too soon, you will find yourself up against a kid who is not fully vested in the solution and not yet ready for agreement.


 


• Fear of losing face. Any resolution that even gives a hint of embarrassment will elicit resistance. They may be looking to you to provide them with some assurances that their dignity will be maintained.


 


• Feeling misunderstood or mistreated. Many adolescents feel this way, or they feel aggrieved or maligned. Whether real or perceived, it does not matter because you are operating from their frame of reference, not yours!


 


#### Tone


 


When you use Tactical Empathy in your day-to-day interactions with your kids, remember that how you say something is more important than what you say. Delivery plays a huge role in how it is received. Your kids need to hear sincerity and genuineness in your communications; otherwise your efforts will fall flat.


If you want to strengthen your relationship with your adolescent or you want to improve a relationship that has been damaged, there is no faster or easier way than using Tactical Empathy to demonstrate an understanding of their worldview and connect with them well enough to build trust-based influence.

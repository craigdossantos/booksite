## The Best of the Rest


 


There are some additional skills you should adopt to help you better navigate tough conversations. Outlined in this chapter are techniques to address counterproductive behavior, saying no, gauging the yes, and summarizing.


 


### I-Messages


 


I-Messages are used to confront counterproductive behavior without being confrontational. They express to the other person how it makes you feel when they do or say certain things.


These can be effective responses to the other person when they are in attack mode, and at some point in any difficult conversation, you will get attacked. Count on it. By simply saying, “When you [the objectionable behavior], I feel [whatever you are feeling] because [the effect it is having].”


Consider the following fictitious scenarios.


Rachel’s IT team worked for months researching three software options their company might use to handle HR complaints and investigations. They analyzed the costs and benefits for each one and strongly recommended the software that was the most expensive initially but would yield the most benefit in the long term as the company grew.


When the C-suite reviewed the recommendation, they opted to go with the cheapest one. They said that investing in the recommended solution would result in a short-term fiscal risk. Rachel did not agree, but she understood. Because her team had put in considerable time and deliberation before making the recommendation, she wanted an opportunity to explain the team’s rationale to her boss. She is an Analyst.


A meeting was set, and Rachel arrived with all the data to support her position. Each time her boss tried to ask a question, Rachel cut him off. As the conversation progressed, Rachel became more animated.


Productive discourse was not happening. As Rachel took a deep breath, her boss seized the moment. “Rachel,” he said, “when you keep interrupting me, I get frustrated because it seems like you are not here to talk with me but at me.”


Rachel sat silently for a few seconds and then offered an apology.


Placing the “when you” before the “I feel” is a departure from other examples of I-Messages. I believe that verbal syntax is important. Therefore, saying “when you” at the beginning of the statement provides a subtle reminder that we are still operating from the other person’s frame of reference. It maintains an atmosphere of respect because it demonstrates that our reaction was based on something they produced.


Experience has shown more positive responses if the “when you” is placed at the front of the statement as opposed to the “I feel.”


I-Messages allow us to address persistent or uncooperative behavior in a nonthreatening fashion, which, in turn, maintains our ability to influence. With the I-Message, you are telling them to knock it off without telling them to knock it off.


When you are engaged in a difficult conversation, chances are that the other side will try to bait you into an argument. Persistent counterproductive behavior damages your credibility as a leader the longer it goes unaddressed. Avoid being pulled into an argument or trading personal attacks with them. An argumentative, sarcastic, or hostile tone will reinforce the negatives harbored by the other side and cause them to rationalize their behavior.


Brittany was conducting a presentation for her boss and ten colleagues when, midsentence, a coworker interrupted her to say he did not think her proposal would work. She told him she would open the discussion up for questions at the conclusion of the presentation.


A few minutes later, the same coworker stood up and walked toward the front of the room, stating why he thought she was off base. Brittany fired back, “When you interrupt me like that, I get distracted because it derails my train of thought.” She followed it with a no-oriented question: “Would it be horrible if you saved your comments until the end and allowed me to continue with what I am saying first?”


The offending coworker sulked back to his seat and never said another word.


The I-Message personalizes you, moving you beyond a leader trying to impose your will, to just being a person.


 


### No-Oriented Questions


 


Yes is commitment, and no is protection. When asking a verb-led question, you are pushing for a yes. This puts a sense of obligation on the other person. Their autonomy is being encroached upon, which can understandably lead to resentment.


No instantly makes people feel safe, while yes makes them worry about they have committed themselves. Nearly every yes is a conditional yes at best and a counterfeit yes at worst.


No is always no, so why not make that work for you to break an impasse, get someone’s attention, or help someone think clearly?


Just change your yes-oriented-question (“Can I use your car?”) to a no-oriented question (“Would it be a bad idea if I used your car?”)


Pushing for a yes via verb-led questions is self-defeating behavior. Most of your yes-oriented questions can simply be flipped to get the same result you want by changing the beginning of them to:


 


• “Is it ridiculous...?”


 


• “Would it be horrible…?”


 


• “Is it a bad idea…?”


 


• “Have you given up on…?”


 


Using no-oriented questions is yet another demonstration that you are trying to see the world through the other person’s eyes.


Imagine the conversation in which you must tell your top performer she is only going to get a 3 percent raise as opposed to an anticipated 5 percent increase based on new budget parameters for increases.


“Sam, this is going to sound terrible (AA). I am limited in what I can give you in terms of cash compensation. I am committed to rewarding you for your outstanding performance. Would it be ridiculous if I shared with you some of the ideas I have to show our appreciation for your accomplishments?”


Or “Sam, I am committed to helping you achieve the professional goals you have for your career. Is it a bad idea if we talked about where you would like to be in the next couple of years in your career and how I can help you get there?”


 


### Phases of No


 


Even the nicest leaders in the world will still have to say no to their employees from time to time. You will reject employees for a myriad of reasons. If there are staffing issues, you will deny leave requests. If there are budget constraints, you will turn down requests for training or travel. Yes, you want to encourage collaboration and brainstorming, but sometimes decisions have already been made and it is time to execute.


It does not mean you are a jerk. It means you are doing what is right for the organization. However, hearing no from the boss can be demoralizing, especially when employees believe that you owe them a yes. Tell your hardworking direct report who has logged twenty hours of overtime this month that she cannot take that much-deserved family vacation, and you are basically telling her to disengage. Do it enough times, and she is off to work for someone else.


Nobody who is successful in any profession can avoid these types of scenarios. Not saying no when you have to causes the person with whom you are dealing to proceed with false assumptions. These will be viewed as traps or even betrayals that will be resented when exposed.


How you turn employees down can make a huge difference in how they react. It is important to remember that how you leave them after your current interaction can have an important influence on your next interaction. The last impression is the lasting impression.


They will not remember as much about the conversation as they will how it made them feel. Leaving your employee with a feeling of having been heard and treated with respect enhances your reputation as a leader. Setting boundaries, confronting, and saying no in a well-designed and even graceful manner changes the way people view you.


Here is an example from a Hollywood movie:


 


Bad guy: What do I want? Let’s see. How about, can I see a priest?


 


Good guy: No, you cannot see a priest.


 


Bad guy: That is good, [Good guy]. You should not let me see a priest. A priest is associated with death and you do not want me thinking about death. But you told me no, [Good guy]. You cannot say no. Never use no in a hostage situation.


 


Good guy: Danny, would you relax a little bit?


 


Bad guy: I am relaxed! But here is some advice. Never say no to a hostage-taker. It is in the manual. Will you tell me no again?


 


Good guy: No.


 


Bad guy: Wrong answer! Never use no, do not, will not, or cannot. All right? It eliminates options. The option that leaves is to shoot someone. Understand?


 


Good guy: Yes.


 


Bad guy: Yes! Good! See, yes is good. You say no again, I will kill somebody. Let’s practice. Can I see a priest?


 


Good guy: You know what? Can we just talk about this right now?


 


Bad guy: You wanted to talk! We are talking! Now, can I see a priest?


 


Good guy: I will see what I can do.


 


Bad guy: That is good, [Good guy]. Now you are learning. I would like a submachine gun to blow everyone away.


 


Good guy: I will look into that.


 


Bad guy: You are doing good. You ever cheat on your wife?


 


Good guy: No.


 


Bad guy: Watch yourself. I will kill someone. You ever cheat on your wife? Answer!


 


Good guy: I will see what I can do. I will have to think about that. I will look into that.


 


The only thing that makes this back-and-forth bearable is, of course, it is fictitious. Just like in the good guy’s case, in the real world we refrain from telling a hostage-taker no outright because we have devised ways to say it without saying it. Expressing it in a manner that invited collaboration and did not reject the hostage-taker personally.


Here is how you can say no as gently and as elegantly as possible without killing morale.


 


### Phase 1: “How am I supposed to do that?”


 


This conveys no without cornering yourself or them. Tone of voice is critical because this phrase can be delivered as both an accusation or as a request for assistance.


The emphasis can be placed on the “how,” “I,” or “that” for very different effects. Depending on the circumstances, you may find it necessary to ask this question several times, with emphasis being placed on different words each time.


This also tends to have the effect of making the other side take a good look at your situation. We call this “forced empathy.” They will be less resistant to the no because of it. Forced empathy is the reciprocal empathy they show because you have consistently demonstrated Tactical Empathy. You are reaping the benefits of investing in it first.


 


### Phase 2: “I am sorry. That just does not work for me.”


 


This is another manner of saying no. It is a little more direct, retains the apology as a means of taking the edge off of the message, and keeps the focus on the situation.


 


### Phase 3: “It sounds like you are in a tough spot. I am sorry. I am afraid I just cannot do that.”


 


Notice Tactical Empathy on the front end. “It sounds like you are in a tough spot. I am sorry. I am afraid…” and assertiveness bringing up the rear with, “I just cannot do that.”


Labeling your employee’s circumstances on the front end of an assertive no statement continues the Tactical Empathy because their innate desire to have another understand is alive and well.


Here, “I am sorry” is important. Ego and authority may tell you apologies are signs of weakness. They imply that you made a mistake. Ego and authority hate that. The reality is that apologies are neutral. The issue is when, how, and why they are used.


When linked to assertion or confrontation, they are effective at softening the blow.


The “I” portion of this statement is designed to bring the focus back to you. It does a great job of removing their justifications as reasons you should say yes. Keeping the focus on your situation tends to limit arguments from the employee and invites them to see things from your point of view.


 


### Phase 4: “I am sorry. No.”


 


This is a slightly more succinct version of the above. If delivered gently, this is completely acceptable.


 


### Phase 5: “No.”


 


The last, most direct way of saying it is just to say it. It is not meant to be, “No!” Verbally, it should be delivered with a downward inflection and regard.


 


### Paraphrasing Plus Labeling


 


If you can summarize your employees’ circumstances so well that they respond with “That is right,” “Absolutely,” or “Hell yeah!” you are in a good spot. A good summary will receive a definitive confirmation. Hearing “You are right” is not as effective. If you can grasp this distinction, you are that much smarter during difficult conversations.


A summary is a combination of Labeling and Paraphrasing. It is summarizing what you have heard so far or know to be the case (Paraphrasing) and how the other person feels about the situation (Labeling).


This indicates two important things. You are listening to them accurately, and maybe even more importantly, they realize you are listening. It also shows you have a good grasp on the circumstances, and it provides them an opportunity to fill in anything you may have missed.


On an unconscious level, they genuinely appreciate it.


Here is what is wrong with “you are right” and why we are often seduced by it. First, we all love being right. It can be as intoxicating as getting a yes and often gives a feeling of great accomplishment. In many cases, we are right! So why not be given credit for it?


The truth is that when someone says “You are right” to the boss it is because, well, you are the boss. They defer to your position of authority over them. Another reason is that as the boss, you have probably been taking an argument-based approach, and you are pushing your point on them. You are showing them you are smarter than they are.


Unfortunately, human nature being what it is, this does not bode well for compliance, agreement, or buy-in as your employees will be much more interested in their ideas than they will yours. Think of the number of times you have said “You are right” to someone else just to get them to shut up and leave you alone.


They have been unrelenting in their approach. The only way you could get them to end it was to issue a “You are right.” They then got a happy look on their face and went away, and you went back to what you were doing.


How many times have you worked very hard to get an employee to see the reason and logic of your thinking and had them respond with “You are right,” only to find they did not change any of the behavior you had been trying to get them to change?


Put this into action and find out for yourself. Fully summarize the employee’s position, both in content (Paraphrasing) and how they feel about it (Labeling) until the only possible response they have is a definitive confirmation like, “That is right.” You will remove false obstacles and create turning points in your relationship that benefit your objectives.


 


### The Rule of Three


 


If yes is a success, what is no? We often ask people we are training this question. The most common response is that no is a failure.


Some people believe the word “yes” is one of the most beautiful words in the English language. It is the word we most often desire because we think it means we got our way.


The desire to hear it blinds us to what is really being said. When implementing the change or otherwise looking for buy-in, leaders often frame it in a “yes-able” proposition. This is widely misinterpreted into the ridiculous idea of building yes momentum. It says that if you get people to say yes three times in a row, momentum has built to the point that when you ask them to buy in, they will automatically say yes!


It is so prevalent in argument construction that the moment anyone starts to try to get us to say yes, our guard goes up.


Most CEQs we hear or use are designed in this fashion. The questioner is quite clearly pushing for a yes. While this may be a good strategy for interrogating a suspect during an investigation, it is not a good strategy for difficult or significant conversations. It diminishes rapport and impedes the building of trust-based influence.


Think about the last time you were on the receiving end of this verb-led question. You are in your office and the phone rings. You answer, and the person says, “Hey, Eric, have you got a minute to talk?” Three things go through your mind almost immediately.


First, you wonder, How long is a minute?


Second, you wonder, If I have a minute to talk, do I want to talk to you?


Third, you wonder, If I want to talk to you, do I want to talk about what you want to talk about?


Clearly it is a good time for the caller to talk or else she would not have called. Eric knows saying yes will obligate him, in the short term. No one likes the feeling of forced obligation.


Have you ever heard a yes and found out later it was not a yes but a no in waiting? There are three kinds of yeses:


 


• Counterfeit


 


• Confirmation


 


• Commitment


 


Since people are so used to others trying to drive them into commitment yeses, they liberally dole out counterfeit yeses like they were Tic-Tacs. The counterfeit yes is often used because the other person wants to gather more information from you before they tell you no. Many of your employees will acquiesce and give you a counterfeit yes just to keep you happy. Remember: the first yes you are given by anyone, employee or otherwise, should be considered counterfeit. It should be tested.


The first time you get a yes—for example, when an employee tells you they will have something for you by next Tuesday—try to Mirror it: “Next Tuesday?” Or Label it: “It seems like next Tuesday is good for you.” They may respond with a yes: “Tuesday is my first day back. I will meet with the team then, and we will come up with a game plan.” This is your second yes: the commitment.


To get to your third yes, Paraphrase: “So if I understand you correctly, Tuesday will be your first opportunity to discuss with the team what we agreed upon, and sometime Tuesday evening I will have something in my inbox from you.” If they responded to this with a yes, this is your confirmation yes. Your agreement is more likely to be held up.


The Rule of Three provides proof of life of the agreement.


 


### Obstacles to Agreement


 


Unsatisfied needs are emotional. You cannot direct your employees’ decision-making until you deal with the emotional aspects of the circumstances as they see it.


Fear of losing face: Your direct reports will look to you to provide them with some dignity during and after a significant conversation.


Feeling misunderstood, maligned, mistreated, or aggrieved: At times you will encounter the toxic employee who feels that the difficult conversation is a result of you, the organization, or some other person being out to get them. Whether it is real or perceived does not matter because it is their frame of reference.


Everything you say and do should be considered based on its impact upon your people or peers. Their perceptions count. Not yours!


Whatever they view as a threat, confusing, or unfair is just that.


 


### Other HNL Strategies


 


• Be supportive.


 


• If you are not sure what someone meant, ask a Calibrated Question.


 


• Avoid saying no until absolutely necessary. Lower expectations. “I will take that under consideration, but it may be a problem.”


 


• Avoid the distraction of your inner monologue.


 


• Be honest.


 


• Be humble.


 


• Repeat what they are looking for, but soften or reframe it.


 


• Do not raise aspirations or expectations.


 


• Be prepared to suggest alternatives.


 


### Takeaways


 


• I-Messages are used to confront without being confrontational. They allow you to address uncooperative behavior without pointing a finger.


 


• Yes is commitment, and no is protection. No instantly makes people feel safe, while yes makes them worry about the commitment they have made. Use no to your advantage by asking no-oriented questions to trigger the safety of no.


 


• Setting boundaries, confronting, and saying no in a well-designed manner conveys a no without cornering you or them.


 


• Use Paraphrasing and Labels to summarize their feelings and circumstances so well that the only way they can respond is with, “That is right!”


 


• There are three types of yeses: counterfeit, commitment, and confirmation. Use the Rule of Three to determine which one you have been given. Label, Mirror, and Paraphrase each one to determine the viability of your agreement.

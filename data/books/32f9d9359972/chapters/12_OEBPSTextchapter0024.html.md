The “Blueflamer” rises rapidly within an organization and is rarely viewed as experienced or accomplished. To compensate for that perception, they are driven to micromanage.


The Blueflamer is in a new position that makes them uncomfortable. The aggressive management style is an initial response used to relieve the discomfort.


 


### The Impact and Characteristics of the Blueflamer


 


• Micromanaging


 


• Arrogance


 


• Bullying


 


• Bad behavior modeling


 


Being a “Blueflamer” is not always bad, but people who are unqualified or simply not a good fit are often given leadership positions.


The best career-development path is to take on a variety of operational roles and become a student of the game before considering promotion.


The Blueflamer is a person who rises rapidly within an organization, spending the majority of their time at each level preparing to jump to the next. They are so named after the characteristics of rocket fuel after launch. The fuel burns blue-hot to provide for the rapid ascent as the vehicle is propelled into orbit.


Some people want the prestige that comes with a higher rank without working to obtain the necessary skills to succeed in that role. Their ambitions are high, and they are only focused on attaining the brass ring. Having spent little time at each level, the Blueflamers are rarely viewed as experienced or accomplished. They are viewed almost exclusively as people who provided enough correct answers during a promotional assessment or interview. Their people know it. They know it. They overcompensate for their lack of experience by micromanaging. They find themselves engaged in a constant internal battle to prove themselves, which translates into an overbearing management style.


The strange thing is that the Blueflamer is not necessarily doing it maliciously. They are doing it because they believe their image, reputation, and future elevation are hanging in the balance. This causes stress, and we have already discussed what that does to their ability to process and comfort level. As I mentioned previously, what we want more than anything else when we are uncomfortable is to get comfortable again as quickly as possible.


Often, people become micromanagers because they do not understand the duties of those under their charge and they fear exposure. Being a Blueflamer impedes the basics of delegation in that they want to make sure their command, control, and confidence are believable.


They wield control and power like a sword and morning star.


Ellison has observed this phenomenon both with Blueflamers and people who were promoted within a “normal” time frame. The bottom line is that their new position produces angst. Their aggressive management style is an initial attempt to achieve some relief.


Ultimately, most Blueflamers do not believe in themselves, and it is hard for employees to believe in leaders who do not believe in themselves. Followers do not need or even want perfect leaders. They want authenticity. Authenticity requires the Blueflamer to recognize that they are not bestowed with all the knowledge necessary to be successful in their current position.


 


### Blueflamers Light Fires


 


### The Impact and Characteristics of the Blueflamer


 


### 1. Micromanaging


 


How many employees have heard this? “I am not gonna get too deep into the weeds on how you run your shop. It is your shop. What I want is for you to make Marshall our next homicide detective.”


This duplicitous statement is a perfect example of micromanaging.


The impact of micromanagement is often ignored. Everyone from the front-line employee to the C-suite recognizes when it occurs within their organization, but most fail to address it.


Executive-level personnel tend to overlook it either because it is never brought to their attention or it is what got them to where they are, and they do not see the problem.


Micromanagement undermines the autonomy of subordinates, with managers hovering over employees and monitoring everything they do. Micromanaging Blueflamers have no problem keeping employees after work, hounding them over the phone, or having them come in on their days off.


Blueflamers are reactive and prone to rush. Unintended consequences of hastily made decisions are given little consideration. Best-case scenario? Highly intelligent and motivated employees “leave” but do not leave. They disengage, opting instead to do nothing until instructed. They stop sharing ideas. They stop taking initiative. They stop investing in the organization and working hard because they know the Blueflamer is likely to change their work anyway.


Worst-case scenario? They actually leave.


 


### 2. Arrogance


 


A Blueflamer working the midnight shift calls the home of a crime analyst at 2:00 a.m. to get an explanation of the report she generated the previous day. The crime analyst is a nine-to-five employee. “I am up. She can be up,” the Blueflamer says when asked about the logic behind the call.


There is a huge difference between leadership, confidence, and arrogance. Ironically, the Blueflamer’s arrogance is compensation for insecurity. Making themselves look good takes precedent over leading their team. Blueflamers do not like sharing the spotlight and take recognition for someone else’s ideas.


 


### 3. Bullying


 


Leading by fear and intimidation is a common coping mechanism for the Blueflamer They need to impose their will in order to offset the perceived lack of respect that they get from their employees. Their communication style is often aggressive and caustic, which gives rise to employees who hate coming to work, voicing an opinion, or otherwise contributing. If employees are only engaging in safe, noncontroversial activities, then the odds are good they are being led by the Blueflamer with relative impunity.


 


### 4. Bad Behavior Modeling


 


Employees learn about and adapt to the organizational environment from the moment they are hired. The Blueflamer’s behavior runs the risk of establishing a workplace model that features self over organization.


If employees perceive that the characteristics of a Blueflamer lead to success, it is highly likely that some will look to emulate them, starting a vicious cycle:


 


• The Blueflamer gets promoted and takes over a new team.


 


• The new team initially starts to function better.


 


• The Blueflamer’s lack of managerial and operational experience starts to manifest itself in how the team performs.


 


• Older, more experienced team members question what the Blueflamer is doing and where they are going.


 


• The Blueflamer starts to adopt the “because I said so” mentality.


 


• Older, more experienced team members withdraw and try to hold on until the next person comes in, or they transfer out or get promoted themselves.


 


• Younger, inexperienced team members see the success of the Blueflamer and try to emulate them.


 


• In two years, the Blueflamer gets promoted again and the cycle repeats, creating a future bad boss.


 


### Promoting the Wrong People


 


Being a Blueflamer does not have to be a bad thing. Young, ambitious managers who work their tails off and aggressively seek to better themselves should be applauded. However, people who are unqualified or simply not a good fit are often given leadership positions, and it has a ripple effect throughout the organization.


Not everyone who is eligible for promotion is ready for promotion. Leadership requires a skillset that can be taught. People often evaluate the potential for promotion based on the employee’s operational effectiveness in their current position. If they have demonstrated excellence, they are deemed capable of supervising others.


But they are being set up to fail. To avoid that, they will adopt the characteristics of a Blueflamer and struggle in their new position.


Ask yourself why the young or inexperienced employee is seeking a promotion. Is it because they have the talent and are ready to move up? Or are they just moving up the ladder by competing for an open slot? If they do not have the talent, experience, and industry knowledge to feel internally confident, how can they be expected to lead workers with years of experience?


Experienced employees taking direction from a new boss they view as incompetent can be disastrous. They tend to become impertinent and, consciously or subconsciously, undermine their new leader.


Just because a leader ascends rapidly does not mean they will not be an effective leader. But to be successful, you have to be humble and expand the breadth of your knowledge. Some leaders do not bother to look for that breadth of knowledge as they gain experience. They just focus on doing whatever will get them promoted.


To avoid these tendencies, leaders should build a culture where employees are encouraged to be on a career-development path that takes them on a variety of operational roles. Encourage them to become students of their profession, immersing themselves in the industry and creating a strong foundation to methodically build their careers.

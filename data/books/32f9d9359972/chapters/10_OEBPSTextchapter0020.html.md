## Toxic Leadership


 


Focusing on short-term gain is a recipe for toxic leadership, exacerbating insecurities, and breaking trust. In environments where toxic leaders are in control, their need for positive reinforcement, elevation of their status, and affirmation of their authority can have a devastating impact on people and organizations.


Hostage Negotiator Leadership is about building individual and organizational integrity, where leaders and employees trust each other to tell the truth.


Integrity is an essential leadership trait. Employees know that if their leader acts with integrity, they will treat them right and do what is best.


The most common lies told by leaders are those designed to save face. Once branded as untrustworthy, leaders have irreparably damaged their credibility.


Human nature causes us to view ourselves as honest people. As a result, we rationalize our behavior to align with that view, regardless of how it looks to an impartial observer.


 


### Human Nature and Self-Awareness


 


“The brain is doing this constant dance of, ‘How do I get more of what I want while holding onto the identity that I think I actually have,’” says Dr. Kevin Fleming, owner of Grey Matters International., a neuroscience-based executive development and coaching firm. “The brain is always wired to reduce dissonance.”


We all have the tendency to rationalize lying. We adjust the story so that it lines up with who we think we are. That way we maintain our consistency. Human beings love to be viewed as consistent in thought, action, and word. If we believe we are fundamentally honest people, we rationalize our behavior to ourselves as ethical—regardless of how it looks to others.


Lieutenant Jeremy Patterson was given both clear instructions and latitude by the chief of police to revamp the narcotics section. Deputy Chief Thomas Riordan disagreed with the changes Patterson was making to the section—specifically, where the street-level narcotics unit would be housed.


Patterson was supported by both his captain and another senior executive. Each had their own internal conflicts with Riordan and their support of Patterson frustrated Riordan tremendously.


In the midst of all this top-level infighting, the sergeant for the street-level narcotics unit fielded complaints from his personnel about Patterson’s changes and took them directly to Riordan. Riordan met with the entire unit.


During the meeting, Riordan informed them that he was going to be replacing the aforementioned senior executive and they need not worry about Patterson’s plans because, “When I get there, things will change. You will not have to worry about Patterson. There will be shit on my dick or blood on my knife when I get finished with him.”


An executive speaking to down-liners about their boss like that is the epitome of toxic leadership. It is destructive in nature. It is no wonder members of the unit felt they no longer needed Patterson to address their issues. They had a sympathetic and undermining ear of a senior executive.


In studying unsuccessful leaders, one of the things that they almost universally lack is either self-awareness (how they are being perceived by others) or empathy. The inability to view the situation through the eyes of another is virtually absent in their repertoire.


The negative impact of toxic leadership is ubiquitous. It matters not whether you are in retail, banking, coaching, healthcare, the military, or law enforcement. The antidote for me has been learning and using Tactical Empathy.


Toxic leaders who lack Tactical Empathy are more concerned with short-term gains and successes than they are long-term relationships.


Remember Colonel Reed from our focus on learning in leadership? He saw how the military was filled with people who were inclined toward action. When he decided to write about toxic leadership, he did so because he wanted to invest time, energy, and effort in providing leaders information that would help them improve. It kicked into high gear when he was appointed the directorship at the War College, where he was motivated to take an even closer look.


The more he looked, the more people reinforced his exploration of toxic leadership. Reed wanted to help these people suffering under abhorrent leadership. “Once I got into it, I could not let it go,” he said.


Reed did not intend to become the father confessor for everybody in the army who had a bad boss. But that is exactly what happened. Hundreds and hundreds of emails hit his inbox, basically saying, “Let me tell you about the son of a bitch I work for.”


One of the emails came from a lieutenant colonel who was commanding a reserve unit. He wrote about the toxicity of his brigade commander, recounting a training brief he delivered. At the conclusion of the brief, the brigade commander “ripped [his] face off.”


Even though he had given the brigade commander exactly what he asked for, what he got in return was humiliation. He asked Reed what he should do. Reed advised him against direct confrontation because the brigade commander had significant power and could ruin his case as well as his reputation. The lieutenant colonel replied, “Well, I have already sent him the attached email,” which basically said, “I am not gonna put up with this. You are not gonna treat me like this.”


He had figuratively squared off with the brigade commander.


Reed winced. “Now it is you or him,” he said. “Only one of you two can survive, and he has got all the cards.”


Survival for the lieutenant, while not impossible, was improbable. As it turned out, the brigade commander’s boss already had an inkling about his leadership. But to this point, he had never had enough current information to act on.


“I said, ‘At this point you have got nothing to lose. Go to your boss’s boss, and have a one-on-one with him and express your concerns.’” So he did. The boss initiated an administrative investigation and subsequently fired the brigade commander.


 


### Avoidance and Mistakes


 


Michael Ellison is the chief of police for a small municipal law enforcement agency. He has nearly four decades of experience in law enforcement, safety, and public policy. Prior to his current job, he rose through the ranks of a major law enforcement agency in another state, starting as a police officer in the late 1970s and culminating in his appointment as commissioner.


Ellison described being an “avoider” as being just as bad, calling it a cardinal sin in leadership. He is referring to those who avoid significant issues and decisions, which can have a paralyzing influence on moving the organization forward. The fear of making critical or difficult decisions is attached to their lack of self-awareness.


When put into a tactical context, for law enforcement, this may mean going into a building or conducting traffic stops. Law enforcement trains their people to be aware not only of themselves but also of the people with whom they are interacting and the environment. It is drilled into their heads so that it becomes second nature.


The same thing holds true for managers. Managers should be able to complete their tasks and survive their job—and “do it in a context where you have not only awareness of what is around you, but self-awareness in what you are doing.”


What gets in the way? Sometimes managers are torn about who they are and how they are being perceived, which can lead to decision or action avoidance. The thinking is that if you do not make a decision, you do not make a mistake. If you do not make a mistake, it is harder to be judged.


Emotions are ever prevalent in workplace decision-making, actions, and significant conversations. Whether it is fear, anger, stress, or frustration, emotions are there. If you do not acknowledge that, you are already operating at a disadvantage.


Ellison has learned that as a leader, you have to be more responsive and understanding of your own emotional state at the time you make decisions or statements; however, his experience with the leave-seeking officer did not prevent him from other emotional missteps.


A number of times during his career, his visceral reaction directed his decision-making and conduct. He equated these reactions to those of a three-year-old child, but you do not have the luxury of behaving like a three-year-old when you are in charge.


Self-awareness means being prepared to bite your tongue.


 


### Jerk


 


For a time, Reed worked for Lieutenant Colonel Eric Ellman, whose conduct was driven by ego and authority. His insecurities were so deep that he needed to constantly remind his people, “I am in charge here, and you are not. I am more important than you are.”


He was not nurturing, and he was offended if one of his subordinates succeeded because he thought it took away recognition from him. He could not live vicariously through the accomplishments of others. Reed said, “That was the worst guy I ever worked for.”


So Reed focused on shielding his lieutenants from Ellman’s influence on them. Ellman was a toxic person. He was bitter and always looking for an opportunity to highlight his superiority.


At the time, Reed was a captain and company commander. Routinely, Ellman would show up in Reed’s area and say, “Walk with me.”


As they walked, he spotted a cigarette butt, a piece of paper, or some other discarded trash.


“Captain, what is that?” he asked.


Reed responded, “That, sir, is a cigarette butt.”


Ellman replied, “I know what it is. What is it doing here?”


“Sir, it was cast here by a soldier who obviously had no pride in himself or his unit.”


Ellman said, “Absolutely right, Captain, and that had better not happen again.” Then he would storm back to his office like he was pissed off.


Reed went back to his office and made a mark on the calendar because “it meant that I was good for about another thirty days.”


On another thirty-day cycle, Ellman walked up to Reed’s predecessor and poked him in the chest with his finger. This was Ellman’s way of drawing attention to the hole in the guy’s T-shirt where the collar met the main fabric. Ellman put his finger in the hole, turned it up, and almost ripped the T-shirt off of him.


“Now, Captain, you are out of uniform. Go home and change, and report to me when you are in appropriate uniform,” Ellman snarled.


Torn T-shirt guy was an Army Ranger—a hardened, trained killer. All in all, a pretty dangerous guy. Conservatively speaking, he probably ran through five to seven different scenarios in his head on how he could disfigure Ellman.


The Ranger shook with rage. Reed was certain the Ranger was going to play out one of the scenarios, but he did not. Discipline got the better of him. The Ranger maintained his composure, went home, changed, and returned.


Toxic leadership is a cancer within any organization.


 


### Integrity


 


#### The supreme quality for leadership is unquestionably integrity. Without it, no real success is possible, no matter whether it is on a section gang, a football field, in an army, or in an office.


#### —Dwight D. Eisenhower


 


In many law enforcement agencies, major cases (usually homicides) are tracked on an acetate board. Those that are open are captured in red ink. Once those red cases have been closed, they are changed to black. During the murder investigation mentioned in Chapter 4, Carlos was inundated with tasks in order to change his murder from red to black.


He was under a microscope. The pressure to perform was intense. To further exacerbate his situation, he and the homicide supervisor, Rick, had a previous history that was less than friendly.


Rick was not mature enough as a leader to put their differences aside and separate Carlos from the tasks at hand. Instead of looking for ways to help Carlos succeed, Rick intentionally left him to struggle and put him in a position where failure was likely.


Ego and authority interfered with the conduct of the investigation.


Rick appeared more concerned with removing Carlos from the case than he was with changing it from red to black. Removing Carlos from the case would have given Rick personal satisfaction. Rick did not like Carlos. Never had. Likely never would. Mike Falconer could see the tension between the two, and it was building to an eventual out-of-control spiral.


The contention over the case came to a head, leading Carlos to demand a meeting with Rick. Carlos did not trust Rick. The mistrust was so deep that Carlos surreptitiously recorded the conversation between him and Rick.


“Hey, what is going on here?” Carlos asked, recorder running in his pocket. “I feel like you guys are shutting me out. Like you do not want me on this case. What is happening?”


Rick said, “You want off the case?”


Carlos replied, “No, I do not want off the case. I want to stay on the case.”


Rick said, “You want off the case, you got it. You are off the case.”


Carlos replied, “I wanna stay on this case. I do not want to be off it.”


Rick said, “I do not care. You are off the case.”


Rick immediately went to the investigations commander, Carolyn, and told her that Carlos had asked to be removed from the case and his wish was granted. Carolyn called Carlos into her office and asked him about it. Carlos told her in unequivocal terms that he did not want to be removed from the case. “That is a lie,” is how he framed it.


Carolyn was confused.


Carlos produced the recorder, slammed it on her desk, and played the conversation he had had with Rick. The recording clearly illustrated that Rick had misrepresented the truth of the conversation.


Carolyn made the integrity issue worse when she said, “Okay, well, I guess you are back on the case. Now let’s just leave this alone.” She did nothing to address Rick’s conduct.


Falconer said it was a disaster. He questioned (to himself) why Rick was allowed to remain supervisor for the case.


He thought that he wanted to quit. I cannot do this anymore. I gotta go. It is terrible.


Ego and authority were at the root of Rick’s lie. He did it because he could. By virtue of his rank over Carlos, he presumed his word would not be questioned. He could not have gone into Carolyn’s office and told her that he kicked Carlos off the case because he did not like him.


Rick was seduced by the opportunity that Carlos had presented him by asking for the closed-door meeting. Ego and authority clouded his judgment, causing him to act rashly and tell the lie. The closed-door meeting would also give him plausible deniability and allow him to save face.


 


### The Experts


 


According to Tim Hird, Executive Director of Robert Half Management Resources (RHMR), “People want to work for those who are ethical. They know that if their leader acts with integrity, that leader will treat them right and do what is best for the business.”


In a survey conducted by RHMR in 2016, both employees and C-suite executives rated integrity as the most essential leadership trait. However, a greater percentage of employees considered it the top quality in an executive.


David M. Long, a professor of organizational behavior, says, “Followers are willing to be vulnerable in a good way to leaders they trust and are more inclined to be satisfied with and committed to them.”


With Tactical Empathy, we show our integrity on the hunt for rapport and trust-based influence. Trust is predicated on truth, and without trust, it is impossible for leadership to be effective. Many businesses and teams fail because leaders are ethically challenged. The reasons vary, but keeping within the context of this book, it has a lot to do with self-image and professional self-preservation. Both are inextricably tied to ego.


Looking back at the conclusion of the Kelly hostage-taking incident in the previous chapter, we held a debrief. This is a “hot wash” of the event that is attended by all of those who were involved, from the IC all the way down to the officers who were at the outer perimeter to keep the press and other looky-loos at bay.


I knew this debrief would be heated. Emotions were high because while David Kelly was responsible for his own actions, we did not want to kill him. But the actual shooting was not the core issue. It was the conduct of the senior executives leading up to the shooting.


The question we had to confront was how ego had influenced decision-making to such a degree that training, policy, and practice had gone out the window.


The mood was so intense that the debrief had to be terminated after a few heated exchanges that got us nowhere.


A few days later, word got back to me that during a meeting presumably with the chief, senior executives had said that I had not briefed anyone in the CP on Kelly’s relationship with his son. They said if I had, no one would have contemplated a hostage rescue.


That was not true. But ego prevented them from admitting to their mistakes or telling the truth. This from people with and for whom I had worked for years. They knew what they did was wrong. But ego would not allow them to accept responsibility.


It was my fault, according to them. They made it clear that they were throwing me and my team under the bus. Leaders often resort to this strategy to save face. They succumb to perceived pressure from their bosses and followers. To them, there is little worse than being viewed as wrong or ill-informed—so much so that they are willing to roll the dice on degrading relationships and irreparably damaging their credibility.


The impact of lying for self-serving purposes is enormous. Biren Bandara, CEO and Founder of the Leader School Incorporated, says there are three common characteristics lying leaders often feel pressured into:


 


1. It is not my fault the project failed. My team messed up. The leader does not take responsibility for their actions. As a leader, your actions include those undertaken by your direct reports since, as the name implies, they act under your direction. Nothing kills credibility more than throwing people under the bus, especially people for whom you are responsible.


 


2. Baffling them with bullshit. This masks the fact that you do not know something with big words, hyperbole, and confusing statements. This is usually used subordinate to superior but is much worse coming top-down. It is completely transparent.


 


3. Lying to yourself. This is usually to minimize weakness or overestimating strengths. This may not always have the worst external consequences but can definitely have a major long-term impact. When you do not allow yourself to ask for help, it is self-applied pressure. Pressure creates stress, and stress makes you uncomfortable. Overestimating your capabilities and knowledge to feed your ego increases your chance of failure.


 


Bandara concludes by saying, “Lying to save face may sometimes seem like the only option when under the gun. It is not. Saving face is usually brought on by self-serving motives and generally results in a loss for someone else.”


Adam Hanft is a brand strategist. He runs Hanft Projects, a New York City-based firm, and is a frequently published marketing authority. He sits on the board of Scotts Miracle-Gro and has consulted for companies that include Microsoft, McKinsey, Fidelity, and Match.com.


Hanft offers the following as explanations for this kind of deception:


 


### Insecurity


 


People lie when the truth is too painful or embarrassing or they perceive it as inadequate. Their self-perception is wildly different from the way they are viewed by others, and they harbor anxiety about being revealed. Outwardly they appear to embody success, but internally they question their self-worth.


New York-based psychoanalyst Elizabeth Singer supports this, saying, “Lying results from a deep-seated belief: I am horrible on the inside. I need to make up a bright, shiny self to show the world. If anyone ever finds out who I truly am, everything will come crashing down.” Ironically, the lies they tell bring about the embarrassment they are trying to avoid.


 


### Self-Deception


 


“People start saying something enough that they start believing it themselves,” says David Reiss, a psychiatrist based in San Diego.


“Looking back on the history of these people, the pattern started before they were powerful. They got into the habit of inflating things out of lack of confidence,” Reiss continues. “Once they got to a higher level, if they have gotten away with it, they think they will never get caught.”


When executives reach the top levels of management, the seduction of the sycophants takes hold, and they start to believe their own accolades and lose sight of the truth.


“You have to be able to hold people accountable. What happens with leaders is there is nobody who is speaking truth to power,” says David Gebler, President of Skout Group, which helps organizations manage people- and culture-based risks. “They have got themselves locked into a world where they really believe they are not doing anything wrong.”

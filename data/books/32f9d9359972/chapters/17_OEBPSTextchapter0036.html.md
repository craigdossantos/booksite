## Conclusion


 


#### “Most of the successful people I’ve known are the ones who do more listening than talking.”

I wrote Ego, Authority, Failure to show that subordinating yourself to your employees, keeping your ego and authority in check, and practicing Tactical Empathy are the most efficient and sustainable ways to increase your leadership performance. Using the skills mentioned in the final chapters, you will create a working environment that engages, respects, and motivates your team members.


The fact that you picked up this book shows a desire to increase your EQ and equip yourself with interpersonal skills to demonstrate Tactical Empathy. If you go out and apply these practices today, you will be performing at a level higher than the majority of the leaders out there. If all you remember after reading this is that it is not about you when you engage in a significant conversation, you will increase your chances of positively influencing those under your charge.


Your EQ and Tactical Empathy should also increase because you have been exposed to several examples of abhorrent leader behavior. You likely recognized their similarity to those you work with or for. Perhaps it is you. If so, through those stories, you have been reminded of what not to do or what you need to change.


Repetition is the key to continual improvement. The skills in the last four chapters may feel awkward when you begin to use them. But stay with it; practicing develops the pathways. The skills do not take a lot of time to practice. I tell all new coaching clients to practice them in conversations that do not mean anything, where nothing is at stake or hanging in the balance—at the coffee shop, picking up dry cleaning, getting the car serviced, or whatever.


In those environments you are free to practice these skills without risk. Once you use one and it produces the desired effect, it is just like seeing a unicorn for the first time. You will not be able to wait until you can do it again. The more success you achieve, the more you will want to employ these skills. Then you will be ready to address your employees from a different frame of reference that will surprise and please them.


If you are new to the sport and you go to a basketball court to shoot free throws, your first dozen will be less than successful. But as you approach five or six dozen, your proficiency will increase.


If you do that for three weeks straight, it will be off the charts. The same is true with the hostage negotiation skills highlighted in this book. After sixty-seven repetitions, you will feel different, and others will begin to notice.


Use the skills with strangers and family members. Sit back and listen to them comment about something being strikingly different about you.


As you embark on this new brand of divergent leadership, remember that ego and authority are like the Force in Star Wars. They can be used for good or evil. Those who underestimate their intoxicating powers will never reach their full potential. Your ego and authority should be treated as living, breathing things. Each is committed to its own survival. They do not like to lose power over you. They will try to convince you that if you do not wield them like a broadsword, you will fail. They will also tell you that to achieve the brass ring at the next level, you have to view the world through your own prism at the expense of all others. It is my hope that you will no longer make yourself vulnerable to their seductions.


Ego and authority will never go away. Nor should they. They are a part of your makeup and at least deserve some credit for your success. Now that you have read this, I hope you have a better understanding of both so that they do not dominate your consciousness as much as they do toxic leaders.


Do not feel discouraged if ego and authority rear their heads from time to time. In some instances, when time is of the essence and the stakes are high, ego and authority are necessary. When the circumstances dictate that immediate, decisive action is required, your ego and authority should be front and center.


 


### The New You: The Hostage Negotiator Leader


 


By taking stock of the cautionary tales of toxic leadership and practicing the skills, I trust you will become a deeper listener and take the time to understand the perspective of the person with whom you are dealing. Your transformation into Hostage Negotiator Leader will not be easy. In fourteen short chapters, I have tried to change the way you think about communicating with your direct reports after years if not decades of doing things your way. That is a lot of “doing” to undo.


The Hostage Negotiator Leader comprehends the necessity of putting their goals and objectives on the back burner to subordinate themselves to their employees in the context of a difficult conversation. Building strong superior–subordinate relationships, gathering information, and promoting morale takes time. It takes commitment, courage, and a lot of trust.


Few leadership attributes are more important than demonstrating Tactical Empathy—establishing rapport, building trust-based influence, and maintaining relationships with your direct reports. The Hostage Negotiator Leader gets that meaningful relationship, and influence starts with respect.


As a Hostage Negotiator Leader, you realize that in order to subordinate yourself to your employees, it cannot be about you. Your ego and authority will keep the embers of ambition and confidence glowing. But as a Hostage Negotiator Leader, you will not provide oxygen to reignite the flames unless it is in the best interest of your team and your organization.


You are now focused on channeling your self-confidence into working on behalf of those you are privileged to lead. The Hostage Negotiator Leader embraces humility. Humility encourages trust. With trust, almost anything is possible.


Humility means staying late to show an employee how to do something. It means taking overwhelming pressures from them.


You are now more attuned to inclusion. Inclusion produces more informed decisions and promotes creativity on the part of team members. Inclusive leadership encourages and enables individuals and groups to contribute to their fullest potential. It also encourages the capitalization of unique experiences, perspectives, and viewpoints for the benefit of the team and the organization.


Demonstrating true humility and EQ will help people see that you are inclusive. You are inviting everyone to be a part of the success of the organization rather than just “do what they are told.” Negative command and control impede creativity and adversely affect morale.


The Hostage Negotiator Leader will lead by listening and asking CQs to challenge and change the conversation. This creates a culture where the organization interacts with one another human to human rather than title to title or rank to rank.


The Hostage Negotiator Leader is self-aware. You appreciate your strengths, weaknesses, and triggers. You keep your emotions in check, and most importantly, you know the impact your words, behavior, and emotions have on others. You welcome feedback. You are aware of how you are perceived. You know your blind spots.


You are hypersensitive to reading people and situations accurately. You understand your people and know how to get the best out of them. You can connect with your team by forgiving past mistakes, putting previous bad blood behind you, getting over petty resentments, and cheerleading when cheerleading is in order.


When everything goes right, you give away all the credit, and when everything goes wrong, you take all the responsibility. Instead of blowing your stack and taking over, the Hostage Negotiator Leader says, “Try again.”


The Hostage Negotiator Leader knows that they are not responsible for the job. They are responsible for the people who do the job. They are examples of the types of leaders who will be emulated by those who follow them and will one day become leaders.


I hope they will become the kind of leaders who are so self-aware, humble, emotionally intelligent, and inclusive that this book will become obsolete.

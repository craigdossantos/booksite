## Delivery, Calibrated Questions, and Paraphrasing


 


Person-to-person communication is composed of three features: content (the literal meaning of the words), tone of voice (including inflection, cadence, etc.), and body language (how the person stands, facial expressions, how they place their hands, arms, and legs, etc.).


When I think of these core features, I am often reminded of the famous line from the movie Cool Hand Luke: “What we’ve got here is failure to communicate.”


How many times can we say the same thing about everyday circumstances or the difficult conversations we have in our personal and professional relationships? “Communicate better” is always good advice, but a few variables make it difficult, like different personality types, skills, and communication methods.


Regardless of the technique you use, how you say something is always more important than what you say.


Now that you have been given the Quick Two Plus One, let’s talk about Delivery, Calibrated Questions, and Paraphrasing.


 


### Delivery


 


UCLA Professor Albert Mehrabian (a communications studies pioneer since the 1960s), whose research provided the basis for the widely quoted explanation for the effectiveness of spoken communication, argued that:


 


• Seven percent of meaning is in the words that are spoken.


 


• Thirty-eight percent of meaning is paralinguistic (the way that the words are said).


 


• Fifty-five percent of meaning is in facial expression.


 


Mehrabian did not intend for this model to put an end to exploration on the subject, but it is pretty insightful. So much so that we use it at Black Swan Group because we see firsthand how important it is to understand how our communication affects human-nature response. Paying attention to the tone of your voice and body language is as important as paying attention to the tone of voice and body language of the person you are in conversation with.


How tone of voice and body language align with the literal meaning of the words is critical to understanding the totality of the message. You can take the sentence “I could just kill you!” and change its meaning entirely based on which words you emphasize, your inflection, and your tone of voice.


Again, this is a two-way street. The person you are communicating with will interpret this in much the same way, whether consciously or unconsciously.


One way to improve your interpretation skills is to Label tone of voice and body language. When someone says yes but hesitates, you can say, “I heard you say yes, but it seemed like there was some hesitation in your voice,” or “I heard you say yes, but it seems like something I said concerns you.”


Speaking with an Assertive (more aggressive), Analytic (colder and dispassionate), or Accommodating (playful, funny, and upbeat) voice will have a major impact on how a message is delivered or received.


When I use an Assertive voice, people are more likely to respond with poor judgment when they are under stress.


When I use my Analyst voice, most fail to really take notice.


When I use my Accommodator voice, a transformation takes place to a more cognitively nimble conversation in a positive frame of mind.


Shawn Achor, one of the world’s leading experts on the connection between happiness and success, said in a Forbes article, “Every single business and educational outcome improves when we start in the positive rather than waiting for a future success. Sales improve 37 percent cross-industry and productivity by 31 percent. You’re 40 percent more likely to receive a promotion and nearly ten times more engaged at work, live longer, get better grades, your symptoms are less acute, and much more.”


In addition, people are six times more likely to agree with someone they like. So it is good to stay away from harsh, sarcastic, or punishing behavior. Smiling at appropriate times during the interaction enhances the person’s positive state.


The 7:38:55 ratio can be used as a guideline to line up what someone says with how they say it. When someone’s tone of voice or body language is not congruent with the words they say, use Labels to uncover what lies beneath. You should also use Labels to stay aware of your own delivery to keep it where it should be.


 


### Poor Delivery of Bad News


 


For a good example of how this can play out, let’s go back to Colonel Reed, who I highlighted earlier in the book. Reed worked for a boss he really liked, despite the fact that “he was an ass-chewing artist. He could bring a young soldier in and reduce him to a quivering pile of jelly in no time at all. I mean, I was in awe of this.”


He tried to teach Reed his technique, but Reed could not do it. It just was not him. He would try it, but it never felt right. On one occasion, Reed was dealing with a problem soldier. The soldier was oppositional, defiant, in trouble all the time, and unrepentant.


They tried everything but could not make an impact on him. The decision was made to “chapter” him out of the army for unsuitability, which is when you discharge a soldier for performance issues that are irrevocable.


Reed called him into his office and said, “This is the last conversation we are ever gonna have on active duty.” He wanted to yell and scream because of the trouble the soldier caused, but he did not. He talked about the nobility of what they were trying to accomplish and how bad he felt because the soldier was not going to be a part of it.


He also told the soldier he was disappointed because he and his noncommissioned officers had failed him. He then told him that “this was the end of the road.” There was nothing that could be done. He was going to leave Reed’s office, get on a bus, and go on to his next life. It was that simple.


The soldier started to tear up.


This was the first emotion Reed had ever seen from this guy. The only thing he had seen from him up to this point was recalcitrance. A tear dropped onto his cheek. “I said to myself, Oh my God. I am finally getting through. All this time, I have been unable to reach this young man, and now we are having a breakthrough here.”


Before long he was sobbing. Reed got up, shook his hand, and wished him well. Reed opened the door, and as the soldier walked out, he walked past the master ass-chewer. “My boss looked at him and let him pass, and then he walked into my office and said, ‘That’s how you chew an ass.’”


 


### When Circumstances Change


 


Communication styles change based on the circumstances. The appropriate communication style for when the enemy is inside the wire and you are passing out the last rounds of ammunition is different than the appropriate style for when you are addressing a team of individuals about a proposed change in the market approach.


With the former, the approach should be authoritative and direct for a very short period of time. With the latter, the best approach would be to slow down and attempt to understand the negative opinions, assumptions, and impressions the team will have with the new market strategy.


Effective leadership is when you meet the needs of the followers and the demands of the situation. Bad leadership—toxic leadership—is when the message is inappropriate either for the followers or the demands of the situation.


Delivering the news to your employees who do not want to hear it is tough. It is even harder when you do not agree with the message or decision you are communicating. Maybe you have to tell your star performer that they are being passed over for promotion, or you are informing your team that they will no longer be assigned take-home cars or telecommuting is no longer an option. In preparing for the conversation, draft a list of Accusations Audits (Chapter 12) to address the negatives likely harbored by the recipients of the message. These are preemptive Labels used to dissolve the negatives. You are, in effect, taking permission away from the other side from using those negatives against you in a difficult conversation.


 


### Calibrated Questions


 


Calibrated Questions (CQs) are similar to open-ended questions.


These questions begin with who, what, when, where, why, and how. Open-ended questions (OEQs) exclude verb-led questions. Questions that begin with can, will, is, are, do, does, etc., can be answered with a yes or a no or closed-ended questions (CEQs) provide little information.


CQs tend to elicit longer responses and more information. The difference between a CQ and the traditional OEQ is with the CQ, we drop the who, what, when, and where because those sorts of questions can be answered too succinctly.


Nearly any CEQ, with some effort, can be reworded into a CQ. “Does that sound like the right move?” can become “How does that move sound to you?” or “What about this move works for you?” You can even ask, “What about this does not work for you?” Any will likely trigger useful information.


Well-timed CQs cause people to stop and think.


Aggressive conflict management types love CQs because they give them a feeling of control. The secret to gaining the upper hand in a difficult conversation with a control-oriented person is giving them the illusion of control. CQs are very effective in accomplishing this.


Very cautious, analytical types will often want time to think before they respond. CQs work with them as well, but the reaction is often delayed.


CQs are basically what and how questions. They should be asked early and often.


CQs are extremely valuable when you are faced with:


 


• A proposed direction change for the team or organization: “What are we trying to accomplish?”


 


• Notifying a subordinate about an unanticipated transfer to a new job: “How is this going to impact your home life?”


 


• Ambivalence or confusion about a problem: “What is the core issue here?”


 


• The viability of a proposal: “How is that worthwhile?”


 


• Determining how you can help: “What is the biggest challenge you face?”


 


• Clarifying an idea: “How does this fit into the objective?”


 


• Uncertainty: “What are we up against here?”


 


• Implementation: “What gets in the way of _______?” “How will you do that?” “How does that affect things?”


 


• An impasse: “What happens if we fail?”


 


• And my favorite, used to elicit exactly what it will take to move the needle with the other person: “What has to be true in order for _________?”


 


Your go-to CQs are “What makes you ask?” or “What makes you say that?” People do not ask great questions or they make statements that cloak an ulterior motive. These two CQs are designed to ferret out the hidden message in the questions or statements during difficult conversations.


They should be locked and loaded and ready to deploy at any time.


Notice I am not suggesting you ask, “Why do you ask?” or “Why did you say that?” There is a real distinction.


Universally, “why” makes people defensive. I have had the opportunity to train businesspeople around the world in hostage negotiation principles and have seen “why” set people off everywhere. For whatever reason, across cultures, races, and genders, it has become part of human behavior to ask someone why when we think they are wrong.


As an experiment, at your next opportunity ask your boss why they want something. Next, ask a peer a why question, and then ask someone younger than you or a subordinate a why question.


The reactions will include some level of defensiveness across the spectrum. Why? First, it sounds accusatory.


Second, it implies there is a right answer and they do not have it. “Why” is often well-intentioned. When we throw out a why, we are not trying to agitate people, but, on some level, that is exactly what we do. Its effect is undeniable.


Of course, the problem is that as the boss, quite often you really need to know why. So here is how to finesse why. Substitute “what.”


“What made that a good choice?” “What made you want that?” Even “What caused you to do that?” is much more likely to get a good answer than “Why did you do that?” What is always the better alternative to why and a much more effective way to get information. Once you get the response, prepare to Label or Mirror it.


Does that mean you should never ask why? No. Here is how you can (in a very calibrated way) use it effectively when we want someone to defend a position that benefits us. This is the defensiveness you want to provoke.


“Why would you want to come to our team/me?”


“Why would you change from the way you are doing things now?”


“Why did you agree to take this meeting/call?”


When you ask this type of why question as a leader, they will not respond with, “Because you are a liar. You are incompetent. You treat people unfairly. You are the consummate micromanager.” Instead, they will list all of the characteristics that you or the situation possesses that make their decision a good one. This is important, especially when you are trying to influence them to support or buy into change or an idea. It is harder for them to balk at your ask when they have already told you how great you are.


They articulate your value proposition before you ever have to say it yourself.


We frequently ask this question of new training or coaching clients. “Why do you want to take business negotiations training from former hostage negotiators?” The respondent then proceeds to tell us all of the value they see in our providing their training.


 


### Paraphrasing


 


Paraphrasing is a negotiation skill that focuses on content. The definition of this skill is very close to what is found in any dictionary. With Paraphrasing, you are listening to the literal meaning of what is being said and using alternative words to repeat it back to convey the same meaning. Paraphrasing demonstrates an attempt to understand the facts and the feelings. So it is different than Mirroring because you are not repeating back to them exactly what they have just said.


Paraphrasing can also be used when a longer message is being relayed. It should be used in relatively short bursts rather than waiting until the end of the long message. To do this effectively, you may need to check in and occasionally interrupt the other person to demonstrate the meaning of what you are hearing.


Some people may find this disconcerting because they have been conditioned to view an interruption as a takeover of the conversation that takes away their permission to speak. Prior to beginning the dialogue, it is useful to advise them that you would like to Paraphrase them while they are speaking just to make sure you are getting it right.


I tell them that as soon as I finish Paraphrasing, I’m going to give the conversation right back to them. Once they are prepared for and then get used to it, they are surprised at how much they like being listened to this well.


Here’s how CQs and Paraphrasing (along with Labels and Mirrors from the previous chapter) look and sound like in a difficult conversation.


The employee, Judy, works for a large retailer and is transferred from one position to another, an important HR role. Internal complaints soon follow, which set the stage for an unpleasant midyear performance review.


 


Leader: What is your future plan? (CQ)


 


Judy: I am not sure what you are asking.


 


Leader: Not sure? (Mirror)


 


Judy: No.


 


Leader: It seems like I was unclear. What would you like to achieve in this job? (Label, CQ)


 


Judy: Why are you asking me this? I love this job. (She bursts into tears.)


 


Leader: (Hands her some tissue and continues.) I am sorry. It looks like I said something to upset you. That was not my intent. What is causing that? (Tactical Empathy, Label, CQ)


 


Judy: You guys threw me into this position. You gave me no training. I do not have any experience. I have no idea what I am doing!


 


Leader: It seems like we put you into an untenable position, and it sounds like you are frustrated with the job and with us because we threw you in the deep end. (Label, Paraphrase)


 


Judy: (Still crying.) Yes! I am dedicated and want to do a good job, but you guys have left me hanging. Now no one has confidence in me. Everything I have done is wrong.


 


Leader: (Silence)


 


Judy: I am just rudderless right now. The pressure has been a lot. People are complaining. It is awful. If I had a little time and a little guidance…


 


Leader: So it sounds like you feel like we abandoned you and left you to your own devices. And it sounds like if you had been given some coaching and instruction, it would have made your transition easier. (Label, Paraphrase)


 


Judy: That is right. You guys just threw me in there hoping I would figure things out and get on track. Well, I am not superhuman.


 


Leader: I am very sorry, Judy. It seems like we let you down. (Label)


 


Judy: (Nods.)


 


Leader: What would have to be true for you to say, “I am happy in my current position, and I feel like management has put me in the best position possible to be successful?” (CQ)


 


With that, Judy laid out exactly what she would need to do her job better.


 


### Takeaways


 


• The Mehrabian ratio of 7:38:55 can be a helpful tool. It reminds us that communication comes in many forms: literal meaning, tone, and body language.


 


• A positive tone puts the other person in a positive frame of mind so you can collaborate.


 


• Calibrated Questions (CQs) are great for generating robust responses. Nearly any closed-ended question can be changed to a what/how question.


 


• Paraphrasing is listening to the literal meaning of what is being said and putting that meaning into another form.

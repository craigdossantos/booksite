## Emotional Control, Decision-Making, and Mistakes


 


Self-control is an essential component of Hostage Negotiator Leadership. When we lose our self-control in a leadership setting, we risk losing respect from those around us. Because difficult conversations bring our emotions to the surface, we need to be mindful of the things that trigger us in negative ways, and we also need to be willing to own up to our mistakes. One of the biggest mistakes we can make is putting our own self-interest above the interests of our colleagues and employees in our decision-making and relationship management.


It has been said before that if you cannot control yourself, then you have no control over your future.


 


### Loss of Emotional Control


 


Back to the high-profile murder case.


Thomas Riordan, introduced in the last chapter, was informed by Rick that Mike Falconer was leaking information about the case to people outside of the agency, something Falconer had been questioned about in the past and vehemently denied.


While at lunch one day, Rick called him and asked what, if anything, he had shared with anyone about the case. Falconer was irritated and questioned the impetus of this latest accusation.


Rick became irate. “You are gonna tell me, and you are gonna tell me right now!”


This emotional outburst caught Falconer off guard. Proving that when attacked, our default is often to attack back, Falconer retaliated in his retort. He realized he should have just said, “Okay, fine. We will go over it again,” but he was fed up. He told Rick he was at lunch and he would explain it again when he got back to the office, and then he hung up. What Falconer did not know at the time was that Rick had made the call from the office and in the presence of Riordan. Falconer called Carolyn and asked her why Rick was questioning him about the leak again. She told Falconer to report to Riordan’s office immediately.


Falconer did as directed and was met by Riordan, Rick, and Carolyn. Riordan laid into Falconer.


“Why are you not telling my supervisor what he is asking you?”


Falconer explained that they had gone over the issue several times, and in his mind, it had been put to bed. Falconer put what happened next into psychological terms.


Riordan lost his shit. “I do not care! You never talk to my supervisors like that! You cannot do that shit! This is bullshit! You are not going to do it that way! Not with me! I want to know every little thing you told [the other agency]! You know, as a matter of fact…”


At this point Riordan stood up, pointed his finger in Falconer’s face, and said, “I want you to write a statement! Everything that you guys have talked about in this case! Every little thing! You better do it right away! If you do not, there are gonna be consequences! There is gonna be hell to pay!”


Riordan stormed out of the office. Carolyn just sat there with an I-do-not-know-what-to-say look on her face. Falconer looked at Rick and thought, I wanna punch you in the balls so bad right now.


As you continue reading this chapter, reflect on the words that Riordan used: “telling my supervisors,” “never talk to my supervisors,” “not with me,” “hell to pay.”


How dare you? I am sorry.


When Chief Ellison was a sergeant, he had an officer who “frankly, got the better of me, and I lost control.” When Ellison lost control, he lost the officer.


The officer requested leave that Ellison denied. So the officer did what many have done and still do. He went “supervisor shopping,” meaning he went to find another sergeant to approve the request.


When the leave was denied again, the officer went to the lieutenant. Ellison just happened to be in an adjacent office when he overheard the conversation between the lieutenant and the officer. The officer told the lieutenant that Ellison was unreasonable.


Rather than walking in and repeating that the reason behind the denial was staffing, he took umbrage with the supervisor shopping and laid into the young officer.


Ellison could have very easily used it as a teachable moment, but he lost that opportunity when he lost control over his emotions. He blamed this on being a new sergeant. He thought, Who is this officer who has the audacity to get a second opinion on my initial decision?


Fortunately for Ellison, he had a mentor, a more senior supervisor, who reviewed the incident with him. Ellison recognized his mistake and went back with a little bit of honest humility and apologized to the officer for losing control, even though he knew it was likely too late.


“I screwed up big time, and I had to go and apologize. That was probably my first big mistake that I had to own up to.”


Even when you own up to it, people may or may not accept it because they may not be confident that you truly understand what you did and how it was perceived. The damage that his ego and authority caused in that one moment took a while to repair.


 


### Getting Triggered


 


Leading is a high-pressure job. Kyle Kensing, online content editor at CareerCast, says that the stress score for CEOs stands at 48.7, or almost ten times as high as the least stressful job in a study CareerCast.com posted in 2018. (For those who are curious, the least stressful job was diagnostic medical sonographer.)


Manage your triggers or they will manage you.


Because of the pressures associated with leadership, it is inevitable that something will occur that will trigger you. You have to have the wisdom to recognize it, pull it back, eat a little crow, and apologize when necessary. More often than not, an emotional decision will not be a good one because you are not thinking clearly.


Remember, when emotions are high, rational thinking is low. When we are emotional, whether we are in a difficult conversation with our spouse, kids, or whomever, we are not thinking rationally. Why would it be any different in a business environment for a leader? This highlights the advantage of time. If you have the luxury of time, walk away from the issue for a while. If a bad decision or statement leaves your mouth beforehand, have the courage to fall on your sword or reverse the decision.


In 2000, during the Democratic National Convention, Ellison was working on his agency’s response to managing demonstrations that were occurring all over downtown. They did not have a chance to deliberate.


In some cases, they conducted planning exercises in anticipation of certain eventualities throughout the day. Accurate, measurable, and reliable information was available. But other times during the same event, they made a decision off the cuff. In this type of environment, the chance of bad decisions being made increases dramatically.


When this happens, how does a good leader respond?


Are you willing to stand up in front of everybody and say, “I made a mistake”? It is difficult for some people to do, regardless of whether they are a leader, manager, supervisor, mom, or dad because we are human. As such, we are reluctant to publicly admit our fallibility.


Most people want to see themselves in a positive light rather than having weakness exposed, so they are torn. Stress creates contradictory beliefs, opinions, and attitudes. As a leader, you want to think you are far too savvy to make mistakes. When presented with evidence to the contrary, stress can set in, leading you to deny your mistake or fail to apologize.


Admitting a mistake is not a sign of weakness. Admitting errors strengthens relationships with direct reports, colleagues, and bosses. It communicates in a powerful way that you are human, trustworthy, and relatable. Legendary Duke basketball coach Mike Krzyzewski (Coach K) wrote, “When a leader makes a mistake and doesn’t admit it, he is seen as arrogant and untrustworthy. And ‘untrustworthy’ is the last thing a leader wants to be.”


The greatest leaders in history are the leaders who can acknowledge their mistakes and learn from them. Today’s leaders need to move outside their comfort zone and face the fact that being afraid of making mistakes or wrong decisions is the beginning of greater uncertainty down the line for their organizations and the people they serve. In other words, playing it safe today may result in a problem the organization cannot mitigate tomorrow.


When most think of toxic leaders, they think of the arrogant bully. But leaders can be toxic by being indecisive or doing nothing. Allowing bad things to happen is equally as toxic. Though some decisions may be the wrong decision, each one gets us all closer to understanding the right course of action.


When leaders play it too safe, they begin to lose credibility with direct reports and peers. Everyone wants to be the hero. No one wants to be the scapegoat, so no one wants to risk making the wrong decision. They surrender to fear and uncertainty, which promotes stagnation.


Self-preservation leads to what Ellison calls “turtle syndrome,” where a manager who takes the first direct hit they have ever experienced in their career ends up figuratively or literally disengaging from the organization.


It is similar to turtles who get hit on the head with a raindrop: some retreat into their shells while others do not know what to do and flip over onto their backs. At some point, all leaders are influenced by the instinct of self-preservation. But hyperconcern about self-preservation is more reckless than building up the courage to weather a direct hit.


The key is to put the direct hit into perspective and into the context of the responsibilities of your assignment. If you are led to the decision because of the facts, you are doing the right thing. If ego gets in the way, you are not.


 


### Do Not Ruffle Feathers


 


As a leader, you are more effective if you are both liked and respected. One without the other results in mission failure and damaged relationships. Strive to find a balance between the two as you create the character you want to exhibit as a leader.


Using Tactical Empathy, a good leader should meet with their key employees or managers frequently for one-on-one sessions to remind them of expectations and understand theirs. With a deferential delivery, you can help them grow and improve. When you create and deliver clarity of expectations and standards, there is less confusion and more effective delegation and accountability.


Holding people accountable can be confrontational at times. Holding people accountable involves difficult conversations. Many leaders avoid tension and conflict associated with progress discussions or performance reviews. Avoidance is detrimental to your organization and the development of your people.


Is it more important to be respected or liked?


Who said it has to be either–or?


Why ruffle feathers when you can build rapport without it?


 


### It Is a “We” Game


 


Leadership is a “we” game. It is not a “me” game. The best leaders keep their self-interest and the interests of their direct reports in mind. They are just as ambitious as the next person.


Personal interest and ambition are not bad things. The bad thing is when ambition gets in the way of taking care of their people.


Whenever it comes down to the employees’ welfare and the narcissistic leaders’ ambitions, their ambitions will win every time. The subordinates sense it. Most have a pretty good barometer on whether or not their leaders have their interests at heart. It is not hard to diagnose.


Deputy Chief Riordan approached Lieutenant Daniel Casey with his brow furrowed. He was clearly irritated. Apparently Riordan and another senior executive had entered a restaurant where Mary was eating with a colleague. The colleague spoke to Riordan and the other executive. Mary, a detective under Casey’s command, did not.


Riordan wanted to know why.


“What is her problem?” How dare she not acknowledge me? was the buried question.


Casey was perplexed. How was Casey to know why Mary had not spoken to him? He had not seen her all day.


“Find out and get back to me.”


“You want me to get her back in here, sit her down, and ask her why she did not speak to you?” Casey asked.


“That is exactly what I want, and I want the answer before she goes home.”


Reluctantly, Casey told Mary’s supervisor, Amy, to have Mary return to the office.


Mary arrived, and Casey asked, “Why did you not speak to Riordan when he came into the restaurant earlier?”


“Are you serious? You guys called me back in here for that? That son of a bitch is such a baby. He is crying about a detective, someone four levels below him, not speaking to him? Unbelievable! After what he did to me and my family?”


Mary held Riordan responsible for the termination of her husband, also a police officer. Her betrayal, embarrassment, fear, anger, and frustration were understandable…at least to Casey.


They clearly were not to Riordan.


Casey reported back to Riordan that she was still smarting as a result of what had occurred.


“Fine. I am ordering you to send her to EAP.”


EAP (employee assistance program) is billed as a voluntary work-based program that offers free and confidential assessments, short-term counseling, referrals, and follow-up services to employees who have personal or work-related problems. Supposedly EAP addresses mental and emotional well-being, but it is commonly viewed by those in law enforcement as a stigma.


Mary was furious.


Casey was dumbfounded.


Riordan was satisfied. He had imposed his will. One way or the other, she was going to acknowledge his station in life—ego and authority, along with their cousin, narcissism, at their worst.


Michael Lehr, President of Omega Z Advisors, says that people who fall into the trappings of power experience several changes.


The first is dopamine surges, causing increases in hubris and risk-taking. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that helps control the brain’s reward and pleasure centers. It also assists in regulating movement and emotional responses.


Hubris develops when self-confidence and pride reach extreme levels.


“When we behave in a narcissistic manner and see ourselves as superior with exaggerated self-belief and overwhelming contempt for others, we are following a hubristic path. Our overconfidence often leads to disaster, as we become incompetent due to arrogance and self-delusion.”


Risk-taking, by definition, defies logic. Why do people gamble? Why do they BASE jump or swim with sharks? It is the dopamine. Those brief moments of ecstasy that keep most risk-takers coming back for more and more. Birth of an addiction.


Second, when people view themselves as more important than others, a sense of entitlement sets in. They assume they “deserve” a certain outcome—a promotion, a win, an accolade—because of who they are and their past efforts.


They think, I earned it. I am owed. I am due. I know what I deserve. Over time, this slowly dissolves the motivation and morale of the people around them. Their ego and authority will not allow them to value others’ time, energy, and effort as highly as their own. It also causes them to overstate their abilities, render judgment, and create unreasonable expectations.


Third, rudeness increases as empathy decreases. Cruel remarks, condescension, and cutting people off or out of conversations is some people’s modus operandi. Rather than subjecting themselves to it, the followers withdraw.


Deliberation decreases as well because while they are not always right, this type of leader is never in doubt.


“One of the most prevalent—and damaging—themes in our culture is the need to be right,” wrote Mel Schwartz, a psychotherapist and marriage counselor. “From the more personal and mundane battle over who said what in the midst of an argument to the larger issues of politics, religion, abortion, healthcare, gun control, or climate change, being right is mandated. It quickens our pulse, causes us to shout, and can sever relationships. It is the raison d’être for most acts of hatred, violence, and warfare.”


Lastly, support of “brown-nosers” or “yes men” is evident and sought. Narcissistic leaders want the rubber stamp of the people they lead. Followers often have real difficulty offering opinions because they lack the courage or the skill to approach this type of leader with a message that runs counter to what the boss is thinking, saying, or doing.


Sometimes they display excessive respect for the role of the leader, their station within the organization, or their responsibilities. Other times they view the leader as “nice,” and people are reluctant to offer professional criticism to “nice” people.


The narcissistic leaders are well aware that they are not open to differing ideas. Dissension or disagreement has been met with negative consequences—transfers to difficult assignments, career paths impeded, and limited access to senior leadership.


Reed says the tendency for these leaders is to “one hundred percent eliminate those who showed resistance. This is a hallmark of poor leadership.” They are incapable of receiving loyal dissent.


Before most major organizational failures, somebody raised a hand and said, “‘Boss, this is not the right thing to do. You do not want to do this.’


“The response is to banish the dissenter to organizational Siberia. Permanent midnight shift watch commander or in the little office down between the elevator and the men’s room in the basement.


“There is always a way that the organization can identify who is on the outs. They abjectly fire them or move them out of the organization.”


This creates a culture of avoidance and reluctance among those who should be providing honest feedback. It leaves the leader ill-informed, isolated, and in trouble.

## Inclusion


 


Inclusion is about empowering people. As leaders we need to encourage smart, capable people to bring their best to our organizations. But when we let ego and authority take over, we are likely to make unilateral decisions that are not people-driven. That model of leadership, creating an environment where the leaders are unapproachable, is a thing of the past.


We need to value others and show them how much they matter to our organizations. An inclusive culture can manage any conflict or difficult conversation with transparency that builds trust and strengthens your mission. This kind of culture that celebrates people and rewards their good work does not have to compromise objective standards.


Inclusion requires listening with Tactical Empathy, which builds habits around respect and humility.


The worst thing you can do is bring intelligent, capable people onto your teams and then treat them like you cannot trust them to make decisions or execute without you hovering over them.


Select them and train them, and then get out of their way.


 


### Let Them Do Their Job


 


#### Leaders need to model the values of their organizations in ways that encourage inclusive behavior. This means inspiring others to collaborate and work together, ensuring everyone is heard and ideas are shared.

Cameron Smith left the community mental health center in an agitated state. Concerned, one of the clinical social workers called the police to conduct a “welfare check” at Cameron’s home. Police arrived at his home and saw his Ford Explorer parked in the driveway. The truck looked as if it had been struck multiple times on the hood with an ax.


Police knocked on the door but got no answer. One of the officers walked to the east side of the house to peer in a window and found himself face-to-face with Cameron, who was looking out of the same window, ax on his shoulder as if it were a rifle.


“Open the door, Cameron,” the officer said.


Cameron shook his head and said, “Come in and get me. I got something for you.”


Two of my best negotiators and I were the first HNT members to arrive on the scene. Jill and Sandy would be making contact with Cameron. Jill was the primary, and Sandy was her coach.


Jill and I came on the team at the same time in 1997, and Sandy joined a few years later. Both were empowered with managing the conversation as they saw fit. I was just there to keep them as distraction-free as possible and organize the responding resources for what had the makings of an extended barricade.


They were about fifty yards from me, in contact via radio.


Sandy said, “He is talking to Jill from the window. He says he wants to finish his peanut butter sandwich and lemonade. The dialogue is good but I need you to get her out of here.”


“Her” was a patrol sergeant, standing right behind Sandy, offering suggestions about things in which she was not trained. It was becoming a distraction for both Jill and Sandy. I took care of “her.”


Sandy knew her job and thus kept me updated on the dialogue I was unable to hear, so I felt no need to inundate her with a bunch of questions.


Sandy said, “She is locked in with him pretty good. He is pissed at the people down at mental health.”


After about thirty minutes of negotiations, Sandy said, “He said he finished the sandwich and lemonade, but he still is not ready to come out…wait…now he says he is ready, but he wants two things. He wants to brush his teeth, and he wants to surrender directly to Jill. He wants her to cuff him.”


Now if you had asked me prior to this incident if I would ever let the bad guy surrender directly to my primary negotiator, I would have told you no. I was trained to never allow a primary to directly accept the surrender of the bad guy, for safety reasons.


Sandy was in essence saying, “Hey, boss, I know what you are gonna think but…”


I said, “What are your thoughts on it?”


Sandy said, “Hold on a sec. Okay. Stafford [the SWAT sergeant] said if we can get him out with no shirt on, his hands over his head, we can walk him out to the middle of the street and prone him out, facing away from us. At that point, Jill can go out and cuff him. He said that they (SWAT) will cover down until the cuffs are on.”


I said, “Is Jill good with that?”


I could see Jill nod her head indicating that she had heard my query over the radio. Stafford, too, gave the thumbs-up in my direction.


So I said, “Let’s do it.”


By this time, we were in the process of obtaining a mental temporary detention order (TDO) for Cameron. Murdering your own car is not a crime; however, Cameron’s behavior was clearly a danger to himself and the community. The TDO was necessary for us to have the lawful authority to take him into custody so he could get the services he needed.


Jill gave Cameron the instructions, and he appeared in the doorway, hands empty, no shirt. He raised his hands high above his head and walked down the steps of the front porch, looking to the left and the right. At this point there were no fewer than six rifles, handguns, shotguns, and less-lethal weapons pointed at him.


He continued into the middle of the street, hands above his head, and turned all the way around to face the house. He then knelt in the street, one knee at a time. Jill told him to lie facedown.


“Fuck that,” he said.


Jill said okay but told him not to move. She exchanged looks with Stafford, and he nodded. Jill walked to the middle of the street and handcuffed Cameron.


I could have overridden the decision on the surrender. But what would that have said to Sandy and Jill? That I did not trust them. It would have been offensive to both. Probably more so to Jill.


Remember, she came on the team with me. Hell, she came on the department with me. We spent the better part of our work lives together for twenty years. She knew as much if not more than I did. If I had said no to the surrender because it did not fall in line with what we always did, it could have done serious damage to our relationship.


 


### New Ideas and Opinions


 


Not asking for or refusing to take input is a quick way to create robotic employees who do not believe they have the authority to offer up opinions, ideas, or suggestions.


Encourage your team to speak their mind no matter how outlandish. With my team, I established early that new ideas and opinions were expected.


During these hostage-taking events, I engage the team in “time-outs,” intentional or unintentional breaks in the conversation with the bad guy where we can come together and brainstorm. Basically, we strategize about where we were, where we are, and where we would like to go. Everyone on the team, not just those in direct contact with the hostage-taker or barricaded person, is allowed to share thoughts, suggestions, and questions.


I constantly remind the team that our brainstorming sessions are a time for candid talk and the expectation is that all contribute. No topic is forbidden. Some ideas raise eyebrows from time to time, but no idea is stupid.


If they have a problem with what we are doing in pursuit of a successful resolution of the incident, the time to learn that is not after the incident is over. It does us no good then. I need to know in the moment because it could have an effect, positive or negative, on the incident.


While I still have the final say-so, they are encouraged to use their knowledge, skills, and abilities to influence my decision. This is what Sandy and Jill did in Cameron’s case.


It is the same approach used in Bo Hanson’s athlete-centered coaching philosophy. Hanson says that if you do not believe your athletes have any right to make decisions, you will not be on board with anything he teaches. Most coaches believe in giving athletes some decision-making leeway, but it is closely managed. This is problematic when you put them out on the court or field, under pressure to perform, and something is not working.


They cannot be expected to make decisions to change the course of events because they have not been conditioned to make them autonomously. They will wait for the coach’s instructions. A large part of the philosophy for coaches and athletes is to create environments where athletes are encouraged to make decisions free from negative repercussions.


The positive effects can even be seen in theaters of war.


Remember Colonel Montgomery? When he was a middle-grade captain, he deployed with his unit for the first time in Operation Desert Shield, the United States’ response to Iraq’s invasion of Kuwait on August 2, 1990.


The colonel and his soldiers became part of an international coalition in the war against Iraq that would be launched as Operation Desert Storm five months later. At the time Montgomery was assigned to the Twenty-Fourth Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Georgia. He was the company commander, in charge of about 180 people in an infantry division of 17,000.


They had just been alerted to the deployment, and many of his soldiers were uneasy.


As they were preparing to leave, Montgomery recalls his soldiers asking, “Hey, sir, what is the big picture? We see what is happening in front of us right now, and we are trying to get our arms around it, but we do not see what is outside our company at the battalion and division level. What is really going on?”


Military experts were portraying any armed engagement with Iraq as a potential bloodbath, which did not help his company from a psychological standpoint. The battalion commander’s lack of Tactical Empathy did not help either. His attitude was, “Do what I say, without question. I really do not have time to listen to you because you are younger and do not have the experience. You just need to move out.”


He was insensitive to the soldiers’ angst and made no attempt to connect with them. He demonstrated little interest in their need for clarification. The silver lining to the battalion commander’s behavior was Montgomery and the other three company commanders began to bond more closely before they ever crossed the border into Iraq.


They started to protect each other. They started to share with each other. They actually started to mentor each other as opposed to turning to the battalion commander.


Montgomery remembered a time just prior to the invasion when all four of them met at some hole-in-the-wall Bedouin tent that sold chickens in the desert of Saudi Arabia. As they sat in the tent, they commiserated about their boss. They asked each other, “Well, how are we going to deal with this? We do not need to take the toxicity this guy is putting out and bring it down to our own units. We basically need to figure out how we can make some good of it.”


This particular battalion commander was on one side of the spectrum. At the other end of the spectrum was General Barry McCaffrey. At the time McCaffrey was a two-star general and Montgomery’s division commander.


Montgomery’s specialty when he was in theater was communications.


McCaffrey spent a lot of time with the communicators in the Tactical Operations Center (TOC) because he wanted to stay abreast of the communications networks, taking particular interest in their flexibility and redundancy. He wanted this level of oversight because he understood if they did not have a robust communications plan, both Desert Shield and Desert Storm were doomed to failure.


McCaffrey made sure to include the company commanders (including Montgomery) at the table when he was talking to the battalion commander each week. Montgomery and his peers knew at least once a week they were going to get a small dose of quality leadership from the senior boss, and they loved it.


They felt empowered because they were being asked for input from a two-star general about something of vital importance to the overall war plan.


It made Montgomery’s job easier because it was clear that McCaffrey understood exactly what his soldiers needed. As a result, he ended up being a de facto mentor to the four company commanders. When the battalion commander dispensed his very narrow and direct type of leadership, McCaffrey would immediately say, “Okay, thanks, Dennis. I appreciate that, but that is not what we are going to do.”


McCaffrey did it in a way that he was not demeaning to the battalion commander, even though Montgomery could sense their relationship was not the best.


McCaffrey was a master at people connection.


McCaffrey walked up to the acetate board, transferred his thoughts to script, and said, “I think this is going to work a lot better, based on what I have seen of the battlefield.” He then looked at Montgomery and his peers and asked, “You guys got this?”


To Montgomery, McCaffrey showed he understood that “if you are going into a battle or some type of a conflict, the more transparency and trust that you get from the people you are communicating with to help you with your operation, the better prepared you are going to be when things actually happen.”


 


### Men and Women


 


When my HNT was at full strength, I had fourteen negotiators under my charge. Of those fourteen, the top three, as far as the ability to engage someone in crisis, were women. Some of the most productive coaching clients I have engaged have been women.


When asked about her most inclusive leader, Sheri Simpson recalled Taylor Black, who she said had the highest EQ and understanding of Tactical Empathy of anyone for whom she had ever worked.


Black and Simpson would often take five-minute “walk and talks,” discussing everything under the sun, but mostly what was going on with Simpson. Whenever Black gave her an assignment he knew she would find difficult, he would apologize. Black was always concerned about Simpson, especially when he put her into a tough spot as was the case with her first assignment to the rideshare team in Malaysia.


The most powerful product of Tactical Empathy is reciprocity. Show it first, and it returns to you. “The first thing he said was, ‘I am sorry you have to go through this, Sheri.’ I responded to him, ‘You know, Taylor, all of us are going through this, and I am sorry you have to be in this situation as well.’”


Simpson said because Black tactically empathized with her, she felt compelled to show Tactical Empathy toward him. She added, “To me he is real. He is human, and that resonates well with me. He was one true leader I felt I could trust. He would tell me he understood what, where, and why I was going through this. He gave me the autonomy and empowerment to do what I had to do…that also he needed my help with general managing. He was all about understanding my emotional state, what I was going through, the stress I was going through, and gave me that support. Because of that I would die for him.”


Black’s successor was the polar opposite. This guy came from a global investment banking firm and was the consummate corporate player. He had no use for EQ or Tactical Empathy.


Because of this, the team felt disconnected from him and viewed him as unapproachable. Simpson said that he was more representative of the men in her space.


Colonel Montgomery learned a valuable lesson on men, women, and Tactical Empathy while working on his master’s degree in human resources from the University of Oklahoma. On his list of required reading was You Just Don’t Understand: Women and Men in Conversation, authored by Deborah Tannen.


The thesis of the book, according to Montgomery, is men know men, but they really do not know women as much as they think they do. On the other side of the coin, women know women and probably know men better than men know women.


She opines the more you know about the other gender, the better you will be able to manage conflict, and the better you will be able to connect and use resources that you probably did not know were available.


He said, “I know as men we tend to be wired to want to fix things and solve problems ahead of listening to somebody talk to us. I would come home as a newly married guy with two kids, and my wife would begin to tell me challenges she had with the kids while I was away doing my army thing.


“As soon as I heard the problems, what did I do? I started to say, ‘Well, did you try this? Why did you not do that?’ Eventually, after she put up with that for several months, she looked at me and said, ‘Bill, if you would have only listened to the rest of my story, you would have heard that I already solved the problem, but you were so quick to make your comments that you did not even listen to me.’”


As a leader, this conversation with his wife of twenty-five years stunned him. He thought that if he was doing this to his wife, there was a good chance he was doing it with the personnel he was supposed to be supporting.


If that is true, he wondered, “What am I missing?”


Tannen notes that women seek connection, while men seek status. Each seeks more than that, but these contribute to the differences in how men and women communicate.


She continues by highlighting that women will listen just to create empathy. They will listen attentively for a long period without interrupting. When they do interrupt, it is to show support or to ask questions for clarity.


Men, on the other hand, have a tendency to interrupt in order to grab attention and demonstrate how smart they are. They are often inclined to avoid asking questions because they believe it exposes weaknesses and gives control of the conversation back to someone else.


As soon as Montgomery read Tannen, he changed the way he came home from “doing his army thing.” He told his wife he recognized he had not shown her that he understood what she had gone through during the day. He was too focused on what was going on in his head.


He began inviting her to share what her gut was telling her about whatever the issue was, even if it was 180 degrees opposite of his thinking. The change in his behavior made a difference. She began to share options, alternatives, and ideas with him that he had not considered.


Had they stayed on the same track as before, it would have taken a toll on their relationship. His encouragement for her to share benefited the family unit. Likewise, the same type of encouragement will benefit your organization.


 


### Sir, That Is Bullshit!


 


Colonel Reed, who I highlighted before, identified a leader under whom he worked multiple times throughout his career. He enjoyed working for him so much that he actually sought him out. Whenever he moved to a new position, Reed tried to follow. At the time, Reed was a lieutenant, and his boss was the “enlightened” major.


The major was influential because he was positive. How could it be that in an organization like the US Army, some leaders were just excited to get up and go to work at four in the morning while others dreaded it?


The “enlightened” major was the former. He had a sense of humor and would mess with Reed in a developmental way. It was fun for Reed to come to work because he knew his major had his best interests at heart.


Prior to working for the “enlightened” major, Reed was very anxious about doing the right things. He wanted to do well without knowing what that really meant. He had no one to show him. He was working for a boss whom he called the “Lister.”


He and Reed would meet in the morning, at which time he would give Reed a list of thirty-five things to complete. Reed would run around for most of the morning, trying to complete all thirty-five. They would then meet for lunch, where the major would give him another list.


This went on for about nine or ten months.


Reed is an ideas guy—a consummate thinker who every now and again comes up with something brilliant. During one of the interactions with the Lister, Reed said, “Hey, boss. I have got an idea.”


The Lister said, “Ah, ah, ah. Stop. Stop. I am not paying you to have ideas. I am paying you to do what the hell I tell you to do.” The Lister was not a bad person. He was just more task-oriented than relationship-oriented, and very focused on his own aspirations.


Fortunately for Reed, the Lister eventually moved on and was replaced by the “enlightened” major.


One day, Reed was summoned to the major’s office after he had been at the helm for a few weeks. “George,” he said, “I want you to do X, Y, and Z.”


Reed replied, “Yes, sir,” spun on his heels, and started to leave.


The major stopped him. “George? What I just asked you to do, did that sound like the right thing?”


Reed was confused and told the major as much. The major responded, “Well, let me put it this way. What I asked you to do…was there anything in there that you thought was stupid?”


Still not understanding what the major was driving at, Reed said, “Hey, you are the boss.”


The major, chagrined, said, “No, no, no! It is not your job to run off and do stupid shit that I tell you to do. It is your job to turn around and tell me it is stupid. So now we are gonna rehearse. Look me in the eye and say, ‘Sir, that is bullshit.’”


Before long they were both standing in the office, slamming their fists down on the table together over and over while screaming, “Sir, that is bullshit!” at each other.


The major explained that was what he wanted from Reed anytime he gave him an order or made a suggestion that did not make sense. He said, “If I tell you to do something that is off, you gotta fire it back at me.”


Two weeks later, Reed was walking by the same office and the colonel—a.k.a. the big boss—was in with the major. As the major saw Reed pass, he said, “George, come in. I could use your advice.”


“You see what he did right there? That, in and of itself, was pretty darned cool. I was a lieutenant. ‘George, I need your advice.’ He is telling his boss’s boss that I am a person whose advice he appreciates. He is cheerleading right off the bat.”


Reed entered the office. The major began telling Reed about the son of a sergeant-major who had been stopped eleven times by the military police, and the sergeant-major was convinced the police were targeting his kid. The plan they were contemplating was to flag the kid’s license plate so that an alert would be generated, instructing the user to notify the duty officer, who would in turn determine if the stop was valid.


When Reed heard the plan, he balled up his fist and slammed it in the middle of the table, looked the major right in the eye, and said, “Sir, that is bullshit.”


The colonel, who was not in on the game, jumped up from the couch and lunged at Reed.


“He was ready to tear my face off. My boss threw his body in between me and the colonel and said, ‘No, sir. No, sir. This is good. This is good, We have been working on this.’”


The major explained what he had instructed Reed to do and then turned to Reed and said, “Now get the hell out of here before he kills you.”


That was the kind of environment he was creating all the time, and Reed loved it.


The major was not this way with just Reed. He was consistent with all under his charge. There was no favoritism. He genuinely cared about each of them and their growth. He was always teaching, and they were always learning.


“It was just a wonderful relationship. He is in a small group of people that if he called me up tomorrow and said, ‘Look, we are gonna assault the gates of Hell. Are you in?’ because he was the one who asked me, I would be in. That is how tight that gets. There is very little he can ask of me that I would not do unless it was illegal. He was the exception, on the positive side.”


The major was nurturing without compromising his task-oriented nature or high standards. He was demanding and challenging. He pushed his people to excel, and they felt that push. They knew he was 100 percent invested in them and would do almost anything for them. It was a two-way street. The best leaders recognize empathy begets empathy.


 


### Respect, Humility, Trust


 


General Martin Dempsey was the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff from 2011 to 2015. After retirement he wrote a book called Radical Inclusion, which described the leadership lessons he learned through the challenges of the post-9/11 years.


Dempsey says, “If you’re a leader, you must commit yourself to learning. And if you really commit yourself to that, you can’t simply be satisfied with reinforcing what you already know. You have to stretch yourself out in order to truly learn, which allows you to do what’s most important as a leader today—be a sense-maker for those who follow you.”


Effective leaders listen. Listening with Tactical Empathy, they learn by showing respect. Dempsey says any meaningful relationship, and any effective collaboration, starts with respect.


Respect is fed by humility. Humility breeds trust. When people trust you, they will work with you. If they trust you, they will do almost anything for you because you are humble, approachable, and transparent.


Yes, leaders should be ambitious, confident, and mission-oriented. But they need to balance those drivers with doing what is best for their people and the organization. Good leaders tamp down their personal ambitions and consider gaining others’ trust first.


Any time you get pushback, dissension, or a no, it is largely due to trust issues.


Finally, Dempsey says the best leaders not only seek but depend on counsel and input from those they lead. This inclusiveness allows them to effectively manage crisis and uncertainty.


Inclusive leaders simply make better decisions.

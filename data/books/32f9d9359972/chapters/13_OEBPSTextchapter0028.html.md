## The Quick Two Plus One


 


Throughout this book you’ve seen the good, the bad, and the ugly of leadership. You can now see why Tactical Empathy is such an important leadership strategy. Now let’s talk about how to employ it and how to execute.


Specifically, let’s discuss how you do these four things:


 


1. Communicate.


 


2. Establish rapport.


 


3. Build trust-based influence.


 


4. Change your behavior.


 


The skills and strategies in the remaining chapters are predicated on understanding these four things in relationship to the human-nature response. The goal is to uncover hidden motivations in order to provide you, as a leader, the information you need to influence and create trustworthy relationships as well as maintain loyalty.


Much of what I will share probably runs against the grain of everything you have ever learned. In essence, it is like learning a new language. For those of you who are fluent in more than your native tongue, think back to how awkward and clumsy you felt when you first learned the new language. Think about how long it took you to become functional, let alone proficient.


The challenge with learning a new skill is never about its complexity. It is about its awkwardness. When your brain tells you that something is awkward, what it is really saying is that there are no cognitive maps or neural pathways yet developed for the skill.


 


### The Quick Two Plus One


 


As I’ve shown, when we put expedience first, an opportunity for negotiation can quickly become a crisis. This happens when we put emotion ahead of logic, which eventually leads to our loss of freedom and autonomy.


Remember how a planned robbery interrupted a rapid response mission in Chapter 3? Mike and Steve’s reaction to this turn of events was to do the most expeditious thing they could think of: take hostages.


Changing the “take hostage” mentality requires a change in attitude and behavior; we need a new language, new practices, and new neural pathways. Skills like Labeling, Mirroring, and Silence are all a part of developing the Tactical Empathy to handle difficult conversations. You do not have to be afraid of difficult conversations. Instead, you can look at difficult conversations as an opportunity to discover information and positively influence behavior.


With Mike and Steve, their thinking was constricted because of elevated emotions. This resulted in binding eight hostages with duct tape and laying them on the floor, with four in front of the front door and four in front of the back door, effectively making them human barricades in the event we tried to enter.


Once Dana got him on the phone, he allowed Mike to vent, dump his emotional bucket, and tell us his story. Mike had spent the previous seventeen years of his life in the penitentiary for armed robbery. Not jail. A state penitentiary. He was now thirty-four years old. So he was a juvenile when he went in the first time. While he was incarcerated, Mike was subjected to some of the most inhumane behavior you can imagine. He even developed a heroin addiction.


Mike said that he had not been able “to get it right.” He told Dana that the “system” was not set up for a Black man to succeed in America today. Dana used what I call “The Quick Two” (Labels and Mirrors) and the “Plus One” (Silence). The more he followed that formula, the more Mike opened up.


Earlier that day Mike had gone to a Kaiser Permanente clinic in Washington, DC, to get a prescription for methadone to help with his addiction to heroin. He did not have the twenty-five-dollar copay and was denied service. Mike told us that his wife was all over him about getting a job, which he was finding exceedingly difficult, as it is with most convicted felons. He was starting to hang out with some of the same criminal elements that got him into trouble seventeen years ago.


He was at his wits’ end, so he copped more heroin and slammed a needle into his arm. A few hours later, he drove to Alexandria to do what he thought he did best: rob a business.


Yet he failed at that too.


Mike then began to cry, at times uncontrollably. He gathered himself just enough to tell us that his name was not Mike. It was Keith. We knew he was Keith all along, but we were operating from his frame of reference, not our own. If he wanted to be Mike, we let him be Mike.


Admitting his real name was a watershed moment for us. It was the clearest indication of rapport up to that point. Likewise, even though he never mentioned Steve—and, in fact, denied that he had an accomplice—Dana never let on that we knew there were two bad guys inside. Slowly Mike’s emotions began to dissipate. He was no longer yelling, screaming, or crying.


Dana had begun to return him to the NFL (normal functioning level).


Mike said he was tired of hurting people and it was going to stop right now. Keith then started releasing hostages—five of them. A nine-year-old boy, a nineteen-year-old pregnant woman, her twenty-one-year-old boyfriend, another woman in her early twenties, and Steve, posing as a hostage.


The dialogue continued, and by using Labels, Mirrors, and Dynamic Silence, Dana demonstrated Tactical Empathy that kept the conversation going.


Then Keith said it: “I gotta go, man.” He was talking about suicide.


Dana begged and pleaded with Keith not to do it. Keith said it was his destiny.


Dana continued to beg. Keith ignored him. “I am gonna let them go, but I am gonna let you know right now, it is over for me,” Keith said, speaking to both Dana and the hostages.


He continued, “Soon as I let them go, it is over. Everybody got that tape off. It is over. Everybody stand up. Everybody get to their feet. Is that your pocketbook, miss? Get your pocketbook. Grab your pocketbook. Okay, hold on for a second. Just stay there. What is your name, miss? Jill. It is okay. You got your pocketbook? Okay. Listen, Jill, when you get out there, I want you to look for my wife. She is a short, light-skinned, Black female. You cannot miss her. Her name is Cathy. Tell her that I love her and I am sorry. Will you do that for me?”


Dana thanked Keith for what he was doing, heaping praise on him in hopes that he would expedite the release of the remaining hostages.


“Oh yeah. I am gonna let them go ’cause it is over anyway. I am—I am done. As soon as Jill comes out, let the door close, and it will be over.”


Jill came out. The glass door slowly closed, and true to his word, Keith shot himself in the head.


Would we have liked to have gotten Keith out as well? Of course, but Keith was the ultimate arbiter of his fate. Our job was to ensure those we were sent to protect went home. We accomplished that.


By using Labels, Mirrors, and Silence, Dana attacked the negative emotions motivating Keith’s behavior and returned him to a more rational state, demonstrating that he understood the motivations behind Keith’s behavior. Keith became more logical, ultimately determining that the hostages had nothing to do with his lot in life, which led to their release.


This was a classic hostage negotiation—a classic difficult conversation. And the skills worked.


 


### Labels


 


Labeling allows you to tentatively identify the dynamics, emotions, or circumstances implied by the other person’s words, actions, or demeanor. This technique is an excellent way to begin and remains extremely effective throughout any difficult conversation.


Derived from emotion labeling in the ALS set, Labeling is one of the most powerful tools in your communication toolbox. At the Black Swan Group, we dropped emotion and just call it Labeling because it can be used for so much more than emotions. While emotions are important and you should never let one go by without hanging a Label on it, if you are saving your Labels just for emotions, you are missing other opportunities to demonstrate Tactical Empathy.


You can Label body language, facial expressions, or the environment. You can even Label cold, one-word answers and silence. When you say, “It looks like…” or “It seems like…” or “It sounds like...” and are met with a “no” or a “yeah” and nothing else, Label it.


Those one-word answers are likely to become a cascade of new information that you otherwise would never have gotten. We have found Labeling dynamics and circumstances to be as powerful in the business world as Labeling emotions.


Labeling shows that you are attempting to gain an understanding of the position the other person is in and the challenges they face. It assists in uncovering the factors that drive behavior. While business leaders have difficult conversations of all kinds with employees, probably one of the most difficult is dealing with a behavior issue.


As an example, Stephen is a ten-year employee of a large company with a worldwide presence. He worked his way up through the ranks, starting on the front line in a position interacting with the public. He was good at his job. He then moved to a technical position and traveled a territory first in a technical support role and then as a manager.


During his tenure, Stephen never had a bad performance review. He always exceeded expectations. Then a new boss came in, and for the first time in ten years, he received marks in a “needs improvement” category.


In his review, the boss noticed Stephen’s eyebrows furrow, and he subtly shook his head from time to time. At one point Stephen openly stated that he thought he did much better and that he was insulted.


Instead of getting into an argument, his boss simply said, “It sounds like I offended you and you think you should be rated higher.”


By using Labels, you are sometimes drawing attention to the obvious, but it does not matter. As I said, people love to have other people understand how they feel. That love outweighs any negative connotations they may have about you using an “obvious” Label.


By the same token, you should understand that any passion, feeling, or expressed thought has both a presenting and a latent emotion. Labeling the presenting is good. Labeling the latent is better. There is simply more power in Labeling something that is not said.


Likewise, Labels help to determine likes and dislikes. A like is an expression of value, appreciation, or desire known as a positive. A dislike is a lack of appreciation, aversion, or reluctance to or for something—in other words, a negative.


The positive or negative emotions a person in a difficult conversation attaches to your words is a signal of their importance. Labeling shows that you are attempting to understand the impact your message is having on them.


By Labeling a positive, you reinforce it and encourage collaboration. By Labeling a negative, you dissolve it. Any negative they are feeling about you, the environment, or the circumstance is the filter through which they receive your message. With negative thoughts, the brain cannot perform at a high or even normal capacity. When a person is threatened, attacked, or afraid, it is difficult for them to take in and process new material, let alone think creatively or collaboratively.


When using this skill, you need to be careful not to deny the negative. Denying the negative puts the focus back on the messenger. A light shift in language can make a big difference. If someone is being a jerk, adding a “seems like” can help soften the blow.


Not every emotion has to be presented overtly or as a sharp dichotomy.


For example, people say that people who hate cheaters love fair play. Or people who are passionate about their significant other have little tolerance for those who are apathetic about their relationships.


These things may be trusted. But to defuse emotions, just make a slight adjustment: “It sounds like you do not like…” or “It seems like you hate…”


Labeling a positive is good; Labeling a negative is three times more effective. Think of them as two targets of equal size and equal distance from you. Shooting at the positive target gets you one point. Shooting at the negative target nets you three. Labeling a negative is three times more potent than Labeling a positive.


You can even Mislabel a dynamic to get to the core of a person’s true motivation. Your employee’s reaction to a Mislabel will reveal more information regarding what is important to them. You might say, “It seems like you are hesitant about these options.” If the options are the issue, they will confirm it.


If the options are not the issue, you might get a clarification, such as, “I am not hesitant about the options. I am hesitant about the time needed to execute all of them.”


Listening to what your coworkers and employees express by breaking down the components begins to slow time down without actually slowing the process down. Why? Because your brain is in high gear as you focus more of your faculties on communication and, consequently, slowly gain the upper hand.


As you prepare for your next difficult interaction with a direct report, write down a summary of the situation as you know it to that point. Then consider the predictable positive and negative issues or passions they are likely to bring up or be harboring when you get them into the office.


Prepare six Labels in advance (Accusations Audits. In Chapter 13, we will take a closer look at how to use Labels for Accusations Audits. To deal with them, Label early and often. Rule of thumb—every fourth vocalization should be a Label.)


 


### Mirroring


 


Part of the “art of listening” is making sure that the other person feels they are being listened to. One of the easiest ways to do this is to simply repeat the last one to five words or gist statements spoken by the employee. This could be something as simple as:


Leader: Would it be a bad idea if we talked about what is going on between you and Mark?


Employee: He is an arrogant a-hole who thinks he knows it all, and I am tired of dealing with his BS.


Leader: Dealing with his BS? Can you tell me more?


Mirroring can be especially useful in the early stages as you are getting acquainted with the employee in the context of a difficult conversation. It helps you gain initial information and begin building rapport.


Mirroring allows you to follow verbally wherever the other person leads, freeing you from the pressure of constantly directing the conversation. Under the stress of a difficult conversation, you may find you are unsure of how to respond to your employee. Mirroring enables you to be a full partner in the conversational dance without having to lead.


With Mirroring you avoid asking direct questions in order to gain information, which can sometimes put the employee on the defensive. You learn valuable information about the circumstances while at the same time providing the employee an opportunity to talk.


Leader: Dealing with his BS?


Inflecting upward on the Mirror says, “Can you tell me more?” or “Please go on.”


Inflecting downward tells them, “I understand.”


 


### Dynamic Silence


 


Stop talking! Remember, it is not about you. It is about them.


Deliberately creating a void in the conversation takes the focus off of you. Dynamic Silence gives you the opportunity to present yourself as selfless. You are showing your employee that you are not concerned with trying to be heard and are more interested in learning. Rather than talking to show how smart you are or to reinforce the hierarchy, stay silent to show that you want to hear from them more than you need to be heard.


Dynamic Silence can be very powerful if used at the appropriate times. So when are the appropriate times?


Immediately after a Label or Mirror.


You will have the urge to justify your Label or Mirror by saying “but” or “because.” We call it “stepping on” your Label or Mirror. Resist that urge. If you feel yourself wanting to say “but” or “because” after the Label or Mirror, replace it with Silence.


Another appropriate time to use Silence is before or after saying or hearing something meaningful. Silence encourages the other person to speak and, in the process, provide additional information. It helps to focus thought and interaction.


Silence is also an effective response to anger when the person you are talking with responds with a highly charged emotional outburst. When the outburst fails to elicit a verbal response, people often calm down. It is very hard to fight with someone who is not fighting back.


Even the most emotionally overwrought people will find it difficult to sustain a one-sided argument. Silence encourages them to return to more productive dialogue, no matter how uncomfortable it is for you. It is equally uncomfortable for the other person. By remaining silent at the right times, we can actually move the conversation forward.


When you are exposed to a new skill, you have to make new connections between neurons in your brain to manage it. In terms of understanding Tactical Empathy and the human-nature response, your visual cortex interprets body language and other unspoken affective cues. Your auditory cortex processes the hidden motivations contained in a spoken response, and other regions of the cortex compare and contrast the input with existing knowledge.


Dr. R. Nathan Spreng, a neuroscientist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, has studied how the brain morphs as we learn. Evaluating frontal magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans, he found that we become more attentive when we learn a new skill. But the areas of the brain sparked by learning become less active over time if we do not provide new stimulus.


Meanwhile, areas of the brain associated with daydreaming become more active as people become more familiar with a task. The more you practice, the less you have to think about what you are doing. How long will it take you to develop a new skill? Studies show about sixty-seven repetitions. It is all about repetition, repetition, repetition. The more you do it, the more confident you become.


The awkwardness you experience developing these skills can be a powerful motivator for you to stop using them. I urge you to resist. Awkwardness is the key to accelerated learning.


Embrace it.

## Tactical Empathy


 


Tactical Empathy is the purposeful, deliberate pursuit to accurately recognize and articulate someone else’s perspective. In that sense it is different from what we think of as emotional empathy. It is also a key component of the HNL framework and relationship management because everybody feels better when they feel understood.


I have seen this every day in my many years of law enforcement. But teachers, doctors, lawyers, and coaches see it too.


Tactical Empathy is a term coined by the Black Swan Group to define the deliberate drive to accurately recognize and articulate another’s emotional state or perspective so well that you could summarize it for them. The best purveyors of this type of empathy are therapists, hostage negotiators, and sociopaths. All three use it, not because we are necessarily nice people but because it works.


Tactical Empathy should not be confused with emotional empathy, which is a subjective state brought on by emotions. Emotional empathy is our automatic drive to respond appropriately to another’s emotions. For example, if someone starts to tell me a story about how they lost their pet and they start to tear up, I too will get a lump in my throat because it is sad to see someone wrestling with that kind of pain.


Tactical Empathy takes conscious effort but also is very similar to intuition. Your gut is telling you this is how they see things, but intuition is not enough. If you do not vocalize it, it matters not. Articulating what you are seeing or hearing is where most people struggle.


I have had great success with it in the world of hostage negotiations, in which we are navigating highly emotional situations where logic and reason are scarce. Similarly, the negative responses you get from your employees often come from an illogical place based primarily on emotion. They will not make sense to you, and they do not have to.


Viewing the world through the eyes of the hostage-taker—or in your case, the employee—allows you to perceive the meaning and motivations behind their behavior as well as the emotions attached to them. You do not necessarily need to get it right. You just need to make an honest attempt to get it right.


People love to have other people understand how they feel.


 


### Lack of Support


 


Harald Jahrling is a famous Australian crew coach who once said, “I don’t believe in sport as a democracy. Sport is a dictatorship.”


Sally Robbins rowed for Jahrling, and pushing herself beyond her physical capabilities caused her dramatic meltdown during the 2004 Athens Olympic final. It is still described as one of the most devastating moments in Australian Olympic history, the moment she stopped rowing in the women’s eight finals, suffering a psychological breakdown.


“Suddenly fatigue sets in, and I just cannot move, you know? It is a feeling of paralysis where you just hit the wall.”


It does not get much worse than that in rowing, a sport that requires fluid and persistent motion. Just stopping is the ultimate contradiction. You just do not do it.


Robbins’s issue was not a secret. She had a history of stoppages that teammates knew about.


Captain Julia Wilson: “I think everybody in Australian rowing knew about it. Whether they say they did or they didn’t, I think everybody knew.”


Teammate Kyeema Doyle: “It was there, but no one talked about it. And to compete to your best ability at a World Cup or a world championships or an Olympics, you can’t spend any time thinking about anyone else.”


Teammate Jodi Winter: “Just occasionally you couldn’t help but think something would spark off about Sally’s past or, ‘I wonder if it’s going to happen again.’ And it’s something you didn’t want to think about.”


As author Peter Wilkins wrote in Don’t Rock the Boat, “It was stunning to find out that there had been so many times where this sort of flaw had surfaced and yet nothing had been done about it. How could this be? How could a rower keep on rowing in a team sport where one of the main priorities, one of the main criteria is the ability to row from point A to point B? From a little bit of digging there was evidence, anecdotally and otherwise, that it had happened possibly as many as nine times before.”


Harald Jahrling supposedly said at the time, “I have dealt with that.” Fully aware of Robbins’s plight, he selected her for the team anyway.


It is a classic example of ego and authority leading to an unhealthy outcome.


It was not just the selection of Robbins that damaged the relationships within the boat. It was Jahrling’s commanding and controlling style. He demanded that the crew operate within a very rigid structure where they were rowing three days on, one day off, keeping them out of sync with the rest of the world. Instead of having a weekend where they could socialize and have relationships outside of the sport, they were locked in with each other for the sake of the boat.


“You ate, slept, and rowed, and that was it. It was horrible,” Doyle said. “Looking back on it, I don’t know how I did it.”


Robbins quitting midrace proved to be a horrible result. The team got to the finish with only seven people pulling the boat over the line, dead last, in front of the world. It was the biggest moment in Robbins’s life and her worst performance ever. The team was racked with anger, frustration, and disappointment. Emotionally, they were devastated.


Was Jahrling there at the pontoon to see them come in and console them? No. According to many accounts, he vacated the facility, leaving the athletes he was responsible for to process what had just occurred on their own.


Many of them never got over it—not just that Robbins had stopped rowing but also that Jahrling had abandoned them. A coach has a responsibility to display Tactical Empathy so that if an athlete or team has a bad performance, the coach is there to provide support. The coach has to be the person to manage the conversation about what happened and the emotions associated with it.


From his perspective as a rower and a coach, Hanson said, “For him not to even be there…it’s almost criminal.”


For his part, Jahrling said he regretted failing to stay by their side and deal with the issue immediately, but he also blamed the Australian authorities for failing to ask him to come back and address the reactions to the team’s performance. When the issue was addressed further, it was suggested that Jahrling caught a flight out of Athens while the team was still “screaming and wailing.”


To this day, Jahrling is unapologetic about his overall leadership style, which is ego-dominant and authoritative. “I’m a total control freak. You can’t get world-class performances if you just let everyone loose everywhere. Someone’s got to be a dictator.” Jahrling is still involved with the sport. He returned to Australian Row in 2016 as a “key strategist.”


This is far too common. Leaders who behave extremely poorly often slip under the radar for a period of time and then resurface somewhere else, leaving a trail of broken employees and organizations in their wake.


Many athletes finish their careers emotionally scarred because of their relationships with their coaches. These coaches harassed, bullied, or communicated with the athletes in a negative fashion. There is a fundamental deficiency in their ability to demonstrate Tactical Empathy and create a safe environment for their athletes—physically, emotionally, and psychologically.


Plenty of examples come out of US colleges every year.


Alexander Wolfe wrote a piece a few years back for Sports Illustrated where he documented abusive NCAA coaches. Wolfe noted college sports has a long tradition of coaches engaging in conduct “that would meet most modern tests of torture.” Hyperbole? Maybe, but I got his point. He said the behavior is surfacing with more frequency now because players, empowered by today’s technologies, are no longer rolling over and taking it.


While there are examples of physical abuse—former Indiana basketball coach Bobby Knight head-butting Sherron Wilkerson during a game in 1994 comes to mind—most of today’s abuse is not physical but psychological or emotional. In one study, 41 percent of athletes reported being so depressed it was difficult to function.


Jim Thompson founded Positive Coaching Alliance (PCA), a San Francisco Bay-area group that focuses on mitigating the negative coaching paradigm. As he puts it, “It’s hard to be driven when you’re being driven. The best way to get the best out of athletes is to create a positive culture in which they’re respected and believe in their value and that the coach believes in them.”


The “my way or highway” coach with an elevated ego and authority has historically been the norm. However, there is abundant research showing that this is not the best way to increase performance.


Surprisingly, the problem of abusive coaches may be greater with coaches of nonrevenue sports than with the larger football or basketball programs.


David Jones, who has covered Penn State athletics for more than two decades, wrote, “The actions of unscrupulous nonrevenue coaches often fly under the radar. Their sports are off on their own, watched and attended mainly by the friends and families of the athletes. What they say and do at practice and even during games is easily overlooked by the mass audience of sport. Few take notice of how they behave. So they can get away with all sorts of conduct high-profile coaches cannot.”


This is where consultants like Hanson have so much wisdom to share: “Sport is played by people, coached by people, and managed by people, so it is imperative to get the people side right. And business is no different!”


In addition to working with athletes, he works with corporations. The corporations usually give Hanson six months to work with a leader in order to facilitate positive change. He coaches people to work together in answering several key questions. How do you start demonstrating more Tactical Empathy toward others? How does Tactical Empathy defuse negativity? How does Tactical Empathy engage people?


 


### Be Like Water, Make Friends


 


Devin Singh, Assistant Professor of Religion at Dartmouth College, teaches courses on ethics, social capital, and the connections between religion, economics, and politics. His self-described “side hustle” is working for a strategic business advisory firm that focuses on creating high-performing culture rooted in trust, communication, and collaboration.


Singh is developing work in emotional and cultural intelligence as it applies to organizations. Through his work, he has learned that in many cases, well after their careers have started, today’s leaders come to the revelation that something is missing.


Empathy.


There is an emptiness and a longing for a deeper, richer sense of character related to empathy that they have never been told how to develop or demonstrate. He has often pondered what it might look like to come into a corporate, government, law enforcement, military, or athletic environment with training on how to build and maintain quality relationships. Similar to Simpson, he asks how the message can be conveyed that this is as valuable as any “hard” skill.


By changing thought processes and behavior.


But why would a leader change? Professor Singh says, “You have to have a reason to change. You have to be motivated. You also have to know how to change. You have to know when it is time for you to change. There are times when a leader’s whole philosophy has to change.” It is not about turning them into different people. It is about changing behaviors that alienate people. Failure to do so is an expensive proposition.


“There is a way in which a certain level of care and concern and connection is pretty necessary—pretty fundamental in order for authentic communication to happen, in order for teaching and learning to take place, in order for a vision to be persuasive to others and get that buy-in and participation.”


An avid martial artist, Singh believes most martial arts, at least in their traditional forms, are about the pursuit of self-discipline, self-control, composure, calmness in the face of adversity, and ultimately trying to avoid violent conflict. This is where martial arts and Tactical Empathy connect. It is not about avoiding confrontation or conflict but rather “how to confront and do conflict well.” In other words, it is cultivating EQ.


“A lot of martial arts traditions will advocate things like self-awareness—being aware of your emotions. Being aware of your stress levels. Being aware of your anxiety and how you might uncritically react and respond to something. So for me, there’s a real clear connection.”


Martial arts icon Bruce Lee once said, “Be like water making its way through cracks. Do not be assertive, but adjust to the object, and you shall find a way around or through it. If nothing within you stays rigid, outward things will disclose themselves. Empty your mind, be formless. Shapeless, like water. If you put water into a cup, it becomes the cup. You put water into a bottle and it becomes the bottle. You put it in a teapot, it becomes the teapot. Now, water can flow or it can crash. Be water, my friend.”


It speaks to the adaptability, flexibility, and strength that you achieve with Tactical Empathy.


Remaining composed during an attack is of vital importance. I call it “staying in your seat.” An attack in the Tactical Empathy sense can be as intense as an ad hominem, emotion-laden attack or as mild as pushback or passive-aggressive conduct.


Maintaining your composure starts with interrupting that automatic or unconscious response to a literal or figurative attack. Many people use the attack as a manipulative tool because they know they will get one of two responses. You will attack back (fight), or you will compromise your position (flee) because you are uncomfortable. Both are emotional responses, and as stated, emotions impede rationale. Tactical Empathy provides a third option: make friends.


In martial arts, a sense of confidence and strength comes from having a specific skillset that might be needed for a certain situation. The same thing can be said for a leader versed in Tactical Empathy. With it, you know you have the ability needed to make hard decisions, influence, convey bad news, lead your people through difficult times, and maintain relationships.


 


### Top to Bottom


 


Simpson, who I highlighted above, promotes a clear vision of Tactical Empathy for her teams, encouraging them to be authentic and empathetic with one another. She ensures everyone on her team feels they have a mentor they can trust and believes in collaborating across teams to drive efficiency and scale for success.


In her twenty years of working for large, international companies, Simpson has used Tactical Empathy to navigate the workplace, winning her “the trust, the heart, and the love of people.” The importance of “dialing up” EQ was revealed to her during her time in the highly political and competitive environment at Google.


There, many of the top “leads” were busy making sure that they stayed at the top at the expense of others. Simpson obliged herself to protecting her team and making sure they could function without disruption, distraction, or harassment from those clawing their way up. Using Tactical Empathy, she managed relationships with those who had C-suite aspirations. Like Pearson, she showed she understood what they were trying to accomplish while staying attuned to the needs of her team.


“In a way, I’m directly negotiating with a senior management, saying, ‘Look, guys. I’ll do my part. I’ll be a really good right hand to you. Just give me all the support that I can have, and don’t disturb my team.’”


Simpson showed her executives that she understood where they were coming from and was trying her best to support them. Her goal was to ensure the mission was accomplished and the executives looked good doing it.


As a leader, Sheri Simpson has an uncanny acumen for Tactical Empathy.


 


### The Birth of Tactical Empathy


 


Active listening skills (ALS) are the foundation upon which Tactical Empathy is built. ALS was introduced by clinical psychologist and psychotherapist Carl Rogers in the 1950s. They were adopted for use in law enforcement in the mid-1980s and have seen increased use in the business world since the mid-2000s.


The adoption by law enforcement came as a result of our recognizing that regardless of the type of hostage-taker we were dealing with—criminal, crazy, or crusader—they all are operating under stress, which induces a crisis state of varying degrees. Borrowing techniques from a psychotherapist seemed to be the right move. Since that time, it has proven, in terms of lives saved, to be the most effective tool we have ever developed…er, stolen.


Tactical Empathy involves you gathering information. Once you have gathered information about the other person’s motivations and show that you understand their current state, you have built rapport. Rapport leads you to trust-based influence, and then you can get to your objective, your case in chief, or your ask. Many times, we get it backward. We want to begin the conversation by stating our objective, and then we are baffled when we get pushback.


My objective as a hostage negotiator was to get the bad guy to release the hostages and surrender. You know that. I know that. Taken out of the circumstance, the hostage-taker knows that. That being the case, how often do you think I picked up the phone, called into the crisis site, and said to the bad guy, “It is Derek from the police department. Since my objective is to get everyone out safe, why not put your gun down, let those people go, and come on out?”


The answer is never! But why? After all, that is my ultimate objective, so why did I not lead with that?


First, they are operating at an intense emotional level in response to a highly stressful event. When emotions are high, rational thinking is low. You cannot begin to direct someone’s decision-making until you address the emotional aspects as they see them.


Second, the sequencing is wrong. The sequence is Tactical Empathy first, objective last. As Dana did with Mike in Chapter 3, it is all about understanding the human-nature response and subordinating yourself. Then it is on to your objective.


Once you understand human nature—i.e., what motivates them, what they value, who they have to influence, and the circumstances they are in—that person ultimately becomes predictable because you have a full appreciation of where they are coming from.


Leaders who display Tactical Empathy are assets to their organizations, in part because they are able to effectively build and maintain relationships, and they understand it is not about them.


 


### Takeaways


 


• Tactical Empathy is not emotional empathy. It is the purposeful, deliberate ability to accurately recognize and articulate another’s perspective.


 


• People love to have others understand what they are going through.


 


• Sequencing is important. The sequence is Tactical Empathy first, objective last. It is all about subordinating yourself and understanding the human-nature response.


 


• Lack of Tactical Empathy has a dramatic effect on individuals, teams, and businesses.

## Humans over Employees


 


People often ask me if hostage negotiation is a science or an art. I tell them it is a combination of both but more art than science, and the subject is people.


Hostage Negotiator Leadership challenges us to focus on people first and mission second. With the right implementation, HNL principles can create a collaborative culture where teams see things from various points of view and seek to achieve the best outcome for everyone involved. This people-first mentality has the power to influence everything from daily decision-making to overcoming toxic leadership. It empowers each individual to take ownership of their work and impact.


This is also a model that views leaders as teachers, and the best teachers are those who do not view themselves as superior. Leaders who look down on others tend to create a perception of power that leads to harsh, dismissive, and condescending dynamics with colleagues and customers. Donavan Nelson Butler, Master Sergeant, US Army, was right: “A leader who allows their subordinates to suffer as proof of who is the boss likely quenches their thirst with salt water from a rusted canteen.”


Successful leadership, like successful negotiation, demands a human touch that is authentic and uplifting, no matter how challenging the circumstances. When we elevate others, we elevate ourselves and create more opportunities for positive outcomes. When we do not, we suffer the consequences.


 


### People, Not Problems


 


Let’s take a look at a real-life negotiation where a young man is threatening to commit suicide in his home. He initiates the call to the police from his home. The initiation of the call was a cry for help that he never got.


 


Call taker: 911 emergency.


 


Grant: Yeah, uh, the—the police are in front of my house right now.


 


Call taker: What is your name, sir?


 


Grant: Grant.


 


Police officer: Shut up and listen to me. Grant. Grant, shut up and listen to me. Grant. Grant. Grant, people are not being allowed in their house, okay? Are you gonna be a coward?


 


Grant: You guys have guns pointed at me—


 


Police officer: Grant, shut up and listen to me. Will you do that? Keep your mouth shut. You need to come out of the house so that other people can go home.


 


Grant: You can send them home. I am not coming out.


 


Police officer: Is that right—that they cannot be in their own house because you are being stubborn and being a coward? Instead of being enough of a man to come outside? Answer me, Grant.


 


Grant: What?


 


Police officer: Are you gonna be a coward and stay in the house, or are you gonna be a man and come outside and take care of your problems?


 


Grant was a son, a brother, a human who was screaming for help. The officer saw him as a problem to be solved. It did not end well.


It is ironic to think, but much like this police officer, leaders and managers can forget the people they are responsible for are, in fact, human. Endless spreadsheets, aggregated salaries, calls for service, office expansions, and more can leave us looking at our employees as pieces to be moved around the organizational chessboard.


For HNL it is critical you do not lose sight of the fact your hostage-taker/employee—or in Grant’s case, a suicidal man—is, in fact, a human being. The moment you forget the person on the other side of a difficult conversation is human—with all that entails, including negative emotions—is the moment you lose your advantage.


 


### More than Numbers


 


Natalie Pearson is a data-driven vice president of human relations of a major communications company whose work deserves some careful attention. Described as a dynamic leader with a wealth of experience and insight in strategic decision-making, Pearson is a true teacher who celebrates success and is candid with all levels of feedback.


She is known among peers as having the ability to see things from all sides and work collaboratively to implement HR solutions that support the needs of the business and her customers, the employees. This demands that she evaluates humans as humans instead of just employees or numbers. In other words, she focuses on the “human” in human capital strategies.


Pearson said, “What that means is before I get into, for example, turnover or retention rates, or how we are going to address a diversity and inclusion shortcoming, I take the time to just talk to people. Just understand the history and what you are doing. Ask some questions.”


From the C-suite executives to front-line employees, all find it easy relating to Pearson. They find her to be “someone who is easy to build trust in and with and someone they can confide in. I really have focused my energies around mastering the art of HR.”


Pearson’s approach to HR (note that her area of responsibility is known as human relations, not human resources) is viewing it as an art as opposed to a science. The art is the relational aspect of HR. It is her way of using Tactical Empathy—understanding the psychology of HR as well as people’s decision-making skills and capabilities.


She recalled one situation where she used the art of HR as the company was contemplating a reduction in force (RIF). RIFs are largely data driven. The numbers will tell you that you must go from x to y: let’s say, for example, from one hundred to eighteen employees. It is pretty cut and dry if you only look at the math. Evaluate the variables. Evaluate the factors. Make your decisions and then execute.


In this particular case, it was not so simple because of the people to be impacted. Looking purely at the data, it made sense that the five people in question needed to go. However, Pearson said, “These were some of our most seasoned professionals who had the history, the context of our operation that the others did not have. And we would have been cutting our nose off to spite our face if we let these particular individuals go.”


The C-suite was fully expecting Pearson and her HR team to agree with the list of names that the data supported releasing and make it happen. When analyzing the numbers, Pearson quickly identified the problem (money) and, more importantly, developed a solution.


She said to herself, “There has gotta be another way that we can get to not necessarily the number but the desired savings because at the end of the day it was about productivity and efficiency, which ultimately has cost implications.”


She considered a variety of tools, resources, and methodologies the company could modify in lieu of releasing these key individuals. The C-suite was surprised at her recommendations but agreed to implement her suggestions for cost reduction and retain the talent.


Win!


The “art” side of HR also called for Pearson to listen to the C-suite beyond the surface-level things and demonstrate she understood their position, making a point to truly connect with them and view the entire situation globally instead of relying solely on the data.


“It is what it is because the data says this is what we need to do. Well, not all business decisions can be made without incorporating the human element into it,” she said.


 


### Where There Is Smoke, There Is Fire


 


Recently, Pearson terminated one of the company directors (I will call him Cody) for his inability to master the company’s core competencies, which include building, facilitating, and fostering relationships. No matter how much coaching and training he received over the course of several years, he could not get it right.


Cody was clearly an outstanding functional expert—if not the best, one of the best in the company.


As much as they valued his subject matter expertise, the way he treated his people was abysmal and did not line up with the company’s “heart.” They had to let him go.


During his exit interview, Cody did not take responsibility for his conduct. It was always someone else’s fault. He still did not see any issue with how he led. As disappointing as the loss was, it fell short when compared to the damage he inflicted on his team.


Pearson said, “I was not aware of how damaged they were due to his leadership style, which lacked empathy and emotional intelligence, until he was removed from the organization. So then I had to do an intervention in terms of really reprogramming them and getting them to build their confidence in leadership because he had virtually destroyed it.”


Where there is smoke, there is fire. Admittedly, Pearson missed some clues. There had been rumors about Cody’s conduct, but Pearson could never corroborate them. She kept a folder regarding the rumors in the hope of someone coming forward with substantial first-person information.


The company has an open-door policy, so any employee can speak to any leader at any time about any issue.


Cody told his team they could not speak to Pearson or her boss without going through him first. Cody had instilled so much fear in his team that no one told Pearson the state of the team—that is, until Marvin announced his retirement.


During his exit interview, Marvin provided information that initiated the investigation that uncovered the depth and breadth of Cody’s toxicity. He recalled one meeting wherein Cody introduced a topic with which the majority of the team did not agree. As good teams do, they respectfully but openly voiced their concerns. This embarrassed and angered Cody. His ego and authority saw it as a personal attack.


After the meeting adjourned, he pulled the dissenters into his office one at a time. With each, he closed the door and the blinds and cursed them out.


In another incident, Cody demonstrated micromanaging inclinations so strong that he needed to know where his remote team was and what they were doing at all times.


He would call them and leave voice mail messages. If they did not call him back within minutes—literally minutes—he would call and text them incessantly until they responded. This started at six in the morning and did not stop until nine or ten at night.


To his demise, Cody looked at those under his charge as no more than chess pieces.


 


### Heart Companies


 


Pearson’s company along with Cisco Systems Incorporated, Breakthru Beverage Group, and Ford Motor Company are a few of the companies that emphasize Tactical Empathy in management and product development. All have invested in empathy training to improve management, retain employees, or guide design decisions.


In Pearson’s company, the core competencies that got Cody fired are applicable to all midlevel managers up to the C-suite—up and down, horizontally, diagonally, and cross-functionally. Employees are evaluated on how well they engage each other and their employees as well as how they execute and manage change.


The company has an extensive in-house training catalog and provides both online and facilitated training. If any leader falls short in these areas, remedial training or intervention is mandated. Pearson said, “We will literally cast a very exhaustive net before we dismiss a leader based on their lack of EQ, soft skills, or interpersonal skills.”


There was no watershed moment that led to the company’s stance on Tactical Empathy, EQ, and relationships. This has been a part of their mantra since it was founded over one hundred years ago. For a little context, it is a privately held, family-owned company.


Family-owned businesses can do things that corporations cannot or will not. Families have personalities, and these personalities impact their organizations. When the founder of the company wrote his living will and testament, he included a clause that said that as long as the company is in existence, its first and foremost obligation is to take care of every employee. Not to make money. Not to grow the company by 1,000 percent. To take care of its people.


What does that look like? Pearson’s company has had a pension since the company was founded, and they are one of the few that still offers this benefit. When the financial market took a hit and interest rates went into the toilet, they found it increasingly difficult to finance pensions for hundreds of thousands of current and past employees. Financially, the company was starting to go negative.


They reevaluated the portfolio while at the same time remaining true to their belief in taking care of employees. They elected to stop offering the pension to new hires while grandfathering those hired by a certain date. In lieu of pensions for new hires, the company began contributing a 60 percent match of their salary into a 401(k). The new employees had to do nothing. No request. No paperwork. Nothing. The company automatically gave them the money.


Recently the company announced they were shutting down the communications center from which they managed job assignments and dispatched technicians.


All announcements of this type, before they are relayed to the employees, are vetted through HR for feedback and input.


Pearson and her team determined the proposed method of delivery for this message would have been a disaster had it gone out as first suggested. The C-suite believed the employees might walk off after being told they would be losing their jobs, which would have a detrimental effect on work routing not just in Virginia but across the entire company.


To soften the blow, they suggested that HR could buy the affected employees pizza, deliver the news, and provide whatever support they needed. The executives added that if the soon-to-be-fired employees were so emotionally distraught that they could not work, they would be allowed to go home, provided they use their own personal time (accrued leave).


“I cannot think of anything more insulting than, you know, we are going to bring you a pizza as a way of showing our appreciation and thanks for all the years. Some of these folks have been in that department for twenty-plus years. So for all your years of service to the company, here is a slice of Domino’s pizza or something. Are you kidding me? Seriously?” Pearson said.


Against the C-suite’s direction, Pearson made a conscious decision to treat the employees as she believed they wanted to be treated. After delivering the news, Pearson and her team stayed with them for as long as they wanted, answered every question, and addressed every concern. She vetoed the pizza idea because of the optics. She wanted to be a little classier. She schedule a going-away party for a day other than the one on which they were given notice that they were losing their jobs.


Pearson believes that all leaders need to know their customers to be successful. As mentioned earlier, the employee is the customer in Pearson’s line of work. She did not dismiss the C-suite’s suggestion because she is a rogue agent, nor does she believe the idea was concocted maliciously. They just did not know her customers as she did and could not appreciate the impact of the message.


“I am obligated to do the right thing by our customer, even if that looks different than a directive from my boss’s boss. At the end of the day, we do the right thing by our employees always, and that is kind of how I practice HR.”


In this instance, Pearson’s way of practicing HR was primarily driven by being sensitive to how decisions and communications impacted her customers.


 


### A True Analyst


 


Diane is one of the smartest people Pearson knows. Her intellect makes others around her feel, well, dumb. It is not something she does deliberately. It is almost unconscious.


Diane’s attunement to data led to her regularly pointing out mistakes or faulty logic on the part of senior executives. A director in one state highlighting mistakes happening at the C-suite level in another does not go over very well. The senior and executive vice presidents made this abundantly clear to Pearson.


It is true they are primarily a “heart” company, but even in a “heart” company, “head” decisions need to be made. The company needed someone with Diane’s skillset. These “head” decisions are made based on data that folks like Diane can analyze and make recommendations about. In short, she was another talent they could not afford to lose; however, the ego and authority of senior executives wanted her out.


Instead of firing Diane, Pearson lowered her profile. She partnered with another leader who appreciated Diane’s analytical mind and put her into a completely different function. Now Diane is working outside of the C-suite’s line of sight and continues to do amazing work. Pearson again was successful in salvaging the careers of some really good talent.


“For me it was a win in the sense that I did not lose that skillset, which we very much needed, but it was also a challenge because I had to go back and repair some relationships. She had torched some relationships that were key for me to get my business objectives accomplished.”


Pearson finds little gratification in accolades and awards. Not to downplay the importance of recognition, but her proudest accomplishments as an HR professional are the teams and leaders she has developed.


“There is one person back in my day at Pizza Hut. He was in operations and I was in HR, and he had a conversation with me. ‘Natalie, I really want to get into HR. I do not think I am a fit for operations. How do I do this? How can I enter into your field?’”


Pearson took it as an opportunity to mentor him. He is now the Chief Diversity Officer at Coca-Cola.


“That is what I find rewarding. I attribute my orientation around servant leadership and around team development to those three leaders who showed me that very early on in my career.”


 


### Teacher Leaders


 


Retired United States Army Colonel George Reed is the Dean of the School of Public Affairs at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs. He is also a specialist in the study of leadership and ethics. His twenty-seven years of service as an army officer culminated with a professorship as the Director of Command and Leadership Studies at the US Army War College.


In 2003, he and his colleagues were the recipients of a question posed by Secretary of the Army Thomas E. White: “What are we doing to identify, assess, and deal with leaders with a destructive leadership style?” That launched a research project headed up by Reed and Dr. R. Craig Bullis. They gathered a group of senior military officers and asked them the same question of destructive leadership. They were met with many incredible stories of horrible leadership.


“It was like pulling the lid off a can of worms. These very successful, very accomplished officers. The best of the best. They were going to be the next generation of general officers, telling stories of how they were mistreated along the way by their supervisors. Stories that were completely inconsistent with the world-class military organization. It was really horrific stuff.”


Reed knew he and Bullis were on to something and it was incumbent upon them to keep the conversation alive. The result was “Toxic Leadership,” published in Military Review. However, after its publication, Reed said the only people interested in the conversation were the subordinates who were suffering under it. No senior military leadership. That was then.


Fast-forward to today.


Today’s army has 360-degree feedback mechanisms in place. Toxic leadership is a part of the vocabulary. It is taught in all service academies and Reserve Officer Training Corps. The reason it caught on is the midgrade officers who were so interested in toxic leadership in 2003 and 2004 are now senior officers in the top levels of army leadership. While their interest has not waned, progress has been slow.


Reed was often invited to speak at general officer conferences about toxic leadership. Many of the senior officers in attendance would say, “Yeah, George, you are probably right. But, man, it is a whole lot better now than it was fifteen years ago. I mean, fifteen years ago these assholes were all over the place. I could tell you stories that could curl your hair. It is a lot kinder and gentler today.”


Reed is a self-described leadership junkie. His “jones” started in the army because, let’s face it, the US Army is a wonderful place to study leadership. There are teams within that are identical. Unit A and Unit B can be in the same headquarters. They can be equipped exactly the same. They can be structured exactly the same. The only difference between them is the personalities of their composition and how they are led.


You will not convince Reed that “leadership does not matter because you can walk into Unit A, and everybody is looking down at the ground, and they are all feeling sorry for themselves, and morale is in the tank. You walk next door to Unit B, and everybody is upbeat. They are mission oriented. They are excited to do their job. What is the difference?”


The leader.


Reed was mentored early in his career by leaders who turned working for them every day into a leadership laboratory. They were always experimenting. Always teaching. Always learning.


When he was a lieutenant, one of them told him, “You need to get a leadership notebook. When you find these little tidbits [of advice], you need to put them in a three-ring binder and then open that up from time to time and page through it.”


These mentors were instrumental in his leadership development, but he also worked for some who were pretty horrible. The differences always fascinated him. He wondered why the disparity in leadership conduct was seemingly allowed to persist to this degree. How can the soldiers in Unit A suffer under terrible leadership and those in Unit B work under caring, nurturing, developing kinds of leadership within the same organization?


Part of the answer was found in the respected leaders for whom Reed worked. These leaders kept two things top of mind: attention to task and attention to people. It was not always a fifty-fifty proposition. Which one was emphasized changed depending upon the circumstances, but the best leaders always paid attention to both: getting the job done and taking care of your people.


The worst leaders were either all about the mission with no focus on taking care of the people, or they simply were self-absorbed to the point where the only thing they cared about was their professional survival.


 


### Long-Term Relationships


 


Mike Falconer is a former sergeant for a municipal police agency who has maintained several long-term relationships with some of his leaders. This was largely due to their work ethic.


One of his front-line supervisors worked with a level of dedication and task mastery that Falconer could not help but respect. Falconer viewed himself and the supervisor as kindred spirits when it came to their approach to work.


Each of them possessed the desire to pour their heart and soul into any task they undertook, day in and day out. This supervisor was not content with showing up to punch a clock; rather, he came into work to accomplish something. To make a difference. To make things better. To get things done.


Another factor for Falconer that led to long-term connections with his leaders was genuine Tactical Empathy. He would do almost anything for those who displayed it.


One of his best memories of this is one in which he was nearly killed.


Zane Devlin, a high school honor student, sneaked out of his house after midnight to steal a gun from one of two local gun stores. When neither store satisfied him, he started back home at about 1:30 a.m. On the way, he shined a small flashlight into parked cars. In a black duffel bag slung over his shoulder, he carried a crowbar, a pair of black gloves, a small telescope, and a ski mask.


A detective who was on a residential burglary stakeout saw Devlin casing the cars. She contacted Falconer and another plainclothes officer, and they converged on Devlin. In a matter of seconds, while the detective looked through his bag, Devlin, who had the knife clenched in his right hand, punched a uniformed officer in the face.


Falconer and the uniformed officer tackled Devlin. The detective hit Devlin with pepper spray. He flailed about and managed to either slash or stab three of the officers before fleeing. Falconer suffered two stab wounds to the torso.


Thankfully, he survived.


Falconer marveled that both his sergeant and lieutenant visited him at his home as he was recovering. “I genuinely felt they cared about me, and it was beyond, ‘I am your boss.’ It was, ‘I really hope you are okay.’ I will always remember that. It was a bad situation, but it was a good memory because it could have gone a completely different way. The things I have seen over time have shown me that was the exception to the rule, unfortunately. That is why, over time, I have appreciated it that much more,” he said.


Falconer continued, “If I had issues at home and I brought it to their attention, they got it. They understood and said, ‘Okay, that is too bad. I am sorry that is going on,’ or they offered their help or their assistance.


“It is genuine because of things that they do and how they do it. They will say, ‘Okay. Hey, listen, get out of here a little bit early today. I know you have X, Y, and Z to do.’ Or if you are working extremely hard, ‘Hey, I know you have been doing a lot. Why don’t you take off an hour early?’ Or, ‘Do you need any help?’”


Falconer called it credible empathy, or empathy that was legitimate and genuine about not only what was going on professionally but what was going on with an employee personally.


 


### Illegitimate Praise


 


Praising employees is a great way to build employee confidence but should be used with caution. Heaping praise on people for doing things that are expected is easily detected and minimizes the significance of legitimately outstanding work.


It lowers the standard of what is excellent.


Giving praise when it is not warranted will have your employees believing that the level of performance being recognized is all that is required to be seen as a high performer. Legitimate high performers will begin to feel as if they are working in a low-performance culture where minimal effort is required for recognition.


When you demonstrate low standards or your praise is not authentic, it diminishes your respect. Eventually, it becomes mere words because your level of recognition does not match reality. If it does not match reality, it loses potency. You lose respect.


Falconer was one of three detectives assigned to high-profile, related murder investigations involving three victims.


One of Falconer’s partners, Carlos, was the lead on the most recent homicide in which the suspect knocked on the victim’s front door and shot her and her nanny.


Both women were wounded. The nanny survived. The other later succumbed to her injuries. After working tirelessly on the cases for years, Falconer, Carlos, and Sergeant Victor Stevenson closed the case, arrested a suspect, and charged the suspect with the three homicides.


This was huge.


It was a major accomplishment.


Rick, the supervising officer for the three, sought to reward them by inviting them to his home for a dinner party—on its face, a kind gesture. The problem was the dinner was scheduled for a weeknight and only Stevenson lived within twenty minutes’ driving distance of Rick’s home. Falconer and Carlos were coming from distances that would have taken them well over an hour to arrive. On top of that, they both had toddlers at home.


Falconer was critical of the gesture because it showed a severe lack of understanding of the impact.


“For me to drive all the way out to his house on a Monday night when me and [Carlos] both have kids at our house…to go celebrate with him at his house where it is convenient for him to be is a complete showing that he does not really care.”


To Falconer, Rick made the invitation as though it was a box he was checking off. Rick knew he had to do something to acknowledge his guys for closing the case, but the ham-handed way in which it was handled appeared not as a reward but an obligation.


“But he did not see it that way because he did not care. It was obvious that was a shallow attempt to reward me for something that you thought that I did well, but you really did not care. It sticks in my mind that he just did not give a shit, basically. It was almost like he should not even have done it at all. The fact that he even did that made it even worse.”


Falconer said he is not looking for constant reinforcement, validation, or praise. He is only looking for it when it is clear he has gone above and beyond what is normally expected of him and the recognition is real.


At his previous agency, praise had become so watered down that people were getting “attaboys” simply for showing up and working their shift. Some people were performing. Some were not. However, leadership viewed all through the same prism. There was no clear delineation between performers and nonperformers.


“I am receiving my outstanding performance award with another detective who everyone in the room knows did not do anything the entire year, who is also getting an outstanding performance award. And I go, ‘This officially means nothing now.’”


 


### Insincere Praise


 


Prior to working for a rideshare company, Sheri Simpson was working in the States as the centralized monitoring organization lead at Microsoft. The marketing and operations (M&O) lead she worked for was young with no experience in leadership or management. She came to Microsoft with a strong consulting background from PricewaterhouseCoopers.


Simpson said the M&O lead lacked empathy, self-awareness, and self-control. She apparently recognized it as a problem because she was able to feign empathy when it benefited her, as was the case for an upcoming inspection.


Before the inspection, she gave her team personalized cards to tell them how fantastic they were and make them feel appreciated.


After the inspection, the M&O lead got the results that she wanted and resumed her customary effect of not caring about the team.


“Immediately, you know that she is not sincere. We were played as a team—as her team—and it backfired. I left because of her. All my other peers, her direct reports, left because of her. To this day, we thought [she] was a very bad hire, a big, big mistake. We lost talent in that situation.”


Insincere praise is just as damaging as no praise at all.


In contrast, Falconer has worked for supervisors who were more sincere in their recognition of a job well done. Amy was one of those supervisors. She would go out of her way to reward her people so that you knew it was unique and specific to the personnel and the job done.


She would say, “‘Hey, come in late. Hey, let me take you out to lunch. Hey, let me do this. Hey, here is a gift card for this.’ It is always something...that she is going out of her way to make sure that you know she really appreciates what you did. She is a good leader and good supervisor.”


Reed agrees. He says the best leaders are great cheerleaders who are always giving credit and always elevating. When leaders do not do it, it is a glaring omission.


Even if they do not engage in otherwise negative behavior, the fact that they are not cheerleading and are not putting their people up for others to see is painfully obvious.

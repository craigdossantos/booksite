### By Christopher Voss, Founder and CEO of the Black Swan Group


 


In the very early days of our negotiation consulting company, the Black Swan Group, we were teaching a block of negotiation instruction within a leadership course being held in Germany. The attendees were members of the China Development Bank.


For an upcoming course that was only a couple of weeks away, I had a conflict, so I advised our German host that I had a substitute, Derek Gaunt, who was more qualified than me and a great lecturer. Andreas, our host, said, “Fine. I am sure if you recommend him, he is excellent.”


Up to that point I had been one of Andreas’s highest-rated instructors. He had been very pleased with my contribution and trusted me.


“How many times has he taught this course?” Andreas asked.


My reply? “Never.”


“Never?” Andreas’s voice shot up about two octaves. He sounded like a teenage boy whose voice was just beginning to change.


Andreas was in a bind. We were just too close to the course date for him to conduct an entirely new search for someone else.


“Can I at least talk to him first?” Andreas pleaded.


“Sure,” I said, and we set it up.


The conversation between Andreas and Derek went well enough that it adequately soothed Andreas’s fears, and Derek went out and taught the course.


The next time Andreas called me for his course, he said, “Hey, you are busy again, right? You have got to send Derek again, right?”


I was one of Andreas’s highest-rated instructors—until Derek became the highest-rated instructor ever. Andreas told me that on a five-point scale, Derek was the only one ever rated a straight five. And the members of the China Development Bank were the toughest raters he had had.


To make things even worse (for my ego), Derek and I were later discussing the training, and he said, “Man, going to that graduation dinner is tough! Those guys drink and toast like nobody I ever saw, and they expect you to keep up with them! How did you handle it?”


I said, “I did not. They never invited me to the dinner.”


Derek Gaunt knows about leadership. Derek Gaunt knows about hostage negotiations. He teaches them both exceptionally. In Ego, Authority, Failure he marries both disciplines to provide cautionary tales and actionable skills to improve leadership performance.


I wrote about Derek in the acknowledgments section of my book Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as If Your Life Depended on It. Derek has been a great wingman and a great friend since I first arrived in the Washington, DC, area two decades ago.


Derek became one of the most important hostage negotiators in the Washington metropolitan area. And that includes local, state, and federal agencies.


He founded or co-founded two different regional hostage negotiation associations that everyone in the DC metro area who wanted to get better at their job attended. Everyone knew him, and when important issues came up that affected the profession, everyone wanted to know what Derek thought.


He personally organized multiagency exercises that hostage negotiators from state, local, and federal agencies attended. He organized weeklong training courses that everyone attended. Even SWAT guys and the regional SWAT association supported Derek.


The hostage negotiators on his team at the Alexandria (Virginia) Police Department (and later the Alexandria Sheriff’s Office) were top notch and knew it was because of Derek’s leadership and dedication to both them and their craft.


Across the board, he is that good. It is my privilege to know him.

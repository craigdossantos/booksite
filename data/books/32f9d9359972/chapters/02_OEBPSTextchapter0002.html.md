## Introduction


 


I began my law enforcement career in 1988. After two years as a patrol officer, I was selected to join an elite, plain-clothes, street-level narcotics unit. My job was to enforce narcotics violations and the accompanying nuisance-related crimes. At the time we were known as the “jump-out” based on the way we conducted our enforcement.


Seemingly out of nowhere, we would arrive on the scene of a street-level narcotics transaction, jump out of our rental cars, and effect the arrest. Then we would just as quickly leave the scene. To a bystander, it looked like a kidnapping. In fact, many bystanders called 911 to report just that when we were making an arrest.


After the arrest, the dealers and buyers would often look for a way out of their charges by cooperating with us, providing information on other dealers or buyers. Sometimes they provided information on more serious crimes.


In these instances, I began to hone my interview and interrogation skills.


I learned if I could say the right thing in the right way, I could elicit a specific response. I was hooked. I wanted to learn more. I attended a Wicklander-Zulawski interrogation class. I was also trained in the Reid Technique of Interrogation and was especially interested in the psychology behind using empathy to uncover information without the bad guy knowing what I was doing. It was a rush. I knew I wanted more. I wanted to be a detective.


In 1994 I got my chance.


When I was a detective, a significant part of my job was to try to get information from people who fell into one of three categories:


 


1. They did not want to provide information that would expose them any further to the criminal justice system.


 


2. They were traumatized by the event.


 


3. They were afraid of the repercussions if someone found out they had given information to the police.


 


Each of the categories required rapport building to allay their concerns and gain their trust so they would willingly provide the information. Building rapport and gathering information was the way to go. I learned this long before the post-9/11 studies on detainee interrogation, one of which stated, “Detainees were fourteen times more likely to disclose information earlier in an interview when the interviewer used rapport-building strategies.”


After a few years of this, I wanted to take this passion to the next level as a hostage negotiator. Many of the negotiators on the team were detectives, which supported the idea that similar skillsets were found in both disciplines.


In 1997, I competed for and was selected to fill one of five spots on our Hostage Negotiation Team (HNT). Immediately I became a student of the game. I immersed myself in everything related to empathy, interpersonal communication, and hostage/barricade management. I was promoted through the ranks, becoming team supervisor in 2001 and then team commander in 2004, a position I held until my retirement in 2014.


I saw a lot, did a lot, and learned a lot about human nature, psychology, emotion, and communication. Over the years, I saw firsthand how important it is to calibrate communication to de-escalate emotional responses and turn negative situations into positives so people can return to, as the FBI’s Crisis Negotiations Unit puts it, the NFL—the normal functioning level.


 


### Hostage Negotiator Leadership


 


As you will see in this book, that is what Hostage Negotiator Leadership (HNL) is all about.


When people learn what I do, I frequently get a series of Hollywood-inspired questions:


“Were you like Denzel Washington in Inside Man?”


“Have you shot anyone?”


“How many times was your life in danger?”


It is a common conversation for me, so instead of playing up the drama, I like to use my training to turn the attention away from me, prompting others to share more about their lives and work experiences.


Most people seem a bit embarrassed to talk about their work; they seem to think that what they do on a daily basis pales in comparison to what I do (or did). But with a little empathetic listening, I am nearly always able to get them to share more.


And here is the fascinating thing. The challenges at their jobs and with their bosses or employees nearly always remind me of my work with hostages and hostage-takers. Their stories contain all the common denominators in hostage negotiations: a negative emotional component, resistance, and difficult conversation. As I thought more about these experiences, it became clear to me that hostage negotiations are just difficult conversations.


When you look at the cover of this book, you might ask, “How can hostage negotiation skills be applied to leadership?”


All leaders, regardless of the environment, come in contact with the same psychological, emotional, and communications challenges that stem from human nature. Let us take sales, for example. Ultimately, sales is about compliance: you have to convince someone else that what you have to offer is better than what they have now. In Daniel Pink’s 2012 book To Sell Is Human, he shows how even non-sales professionals spend up to 40 percent of their day trying to influence their peers or change their peers’ behavior in one way or another.


As a hostage negotiator, I was the ultimate compliance professional. I sold jail time, and I got hostage-takers to buy what I was selling. An armed hostage-taker, with seemingly all the leverage, eventually agreed with me that spending the next twenty years behind bars was better than the alternative—not just because the twenty SWAT guys surrounding the crisis site were ready, willing, and able to rock his world but because I built enough rapport and trust-based influence with him.


David Nye, Chief of Police in Fredericksburg, Virginia, once said, “I have never been a negotiator, but it seems to me there are a lot of parallels between leadership and hostage negotiations. It is how you treat people. Do they feel like they matter? Do they feel like you care about them at all? In your negotiations, it is listening to him and showing some empathy. You matter. I care. Yeah, there are a lot of parallels to leadership.”


What if you began to treat your employees with the same level of deference and thoughtfulness as negotiators do hostage-takers?


What if you showed your employees that you could subordinate yourself to them?


What if you began to realize and act as if it was not all about you?


I believe Hostage Negotiator Leadership will bring these questions to the front of your mind, increasing your ability to handle difficult conversations and helping you become a more effective leader.


The concept of EQ was introduced in 1990 by Peter Salovey and John D. Mayer and then taken on a deeper dive in 1995 by Daniel Goleman when he penned a book of the same name. In the intervening twenty-eight years, many more books have been written espousing the virtues of EQ in leadership. But here we are, still talking about the same problem: the perpetual lack of it.


Even in highly successful companies with leaders who may be perceived well, employees frequently cite their boss as the primary reason they leave their job. Common factors that contribute to employee departure are management style, condescending attitudes, and cruelty. This is what happens when ego and authority take over.


Makes sense, but why is this the case? Why are poor management style, condescension, and ill temper so prevalent?


There are several reasons.


First, some leaders fixate on maintaining or enhancing their self-image.


Second, ego is an emotion that clouds judgment, and authority supports and feeds ego.


Third, not enough leaders learn how to demonstrate empathy beyond a generic facade. Bosses are told, “Do not be a jerk,” “Listen to your employees,” “Build relationships,” “Communicate better.” All of these are touted as necessary for leadership success. But how do you do it?


I began to answer this question for myself by viewing my subordinates and colleagues with the same level of attention and consideration as I would in a hostage crisis. In the simplest terms, once you begin to treat every employee like a hostage-taker and every difficult conversation like a negotiation where you are the negotiator, you will think, act, and speak differently.


In the United States, hostage negotiators have a success rate of over 90 percent in influencing surrender.


What is your success rate of influencing others?


Even the most influential people are probably only successful about 35–40 percent of the time. Why the disparity? Is it because hostage negotiators are smarter than everybody else? Hardly. It is because we are versed in skills that are based on the human-nature response.


Once you understand human nature and seriously consider what is important to the other person—what they value, their environment, or their circumstances—you can make more informed predictions about your outcomes and become a more successful leader.


The framework you will discover in Ego, Authority, Failure is designed to facilitate a change in the way leaders and managers think about communicating with peers, superiors, and direct reports. It will teach you the skills necessary to listen better, get more positive outcomes, create happier employees, and maintain a better workplace environment.


 


### How to Read this Book


 


In almost thirty years of law enforcement and hostage negotiations, I have been a part of many incidents involving life and death as well as hundreds of practical scenarios and training activities. In that time, I have helped hundreds of people apply the principles of hostage negotiations to everyday leadership.


In this book, you will hear stories at the intersection of hostage negotiation skills and leadership performance to demonstrate:


 


• What makes the good leaders good and the bad ones bad.


 


• How ego can negatively influence everything, including life-and-death decisions.


 


• The power and purpose of emotional intelligence and Tactical Empathy.


 


Like you, I have witnessed and been victimized by leaders whose ego and authority created what is commonly referred to as a toxic work environment. I saw or reported to the narcissist, the bully, the incompetent, the indecisive, and the liar. Most of these leaders were smart. They had the capacity to be better. But they were never taught the basic interpersonal skills necessary to demonstrate empathy or manage their ego and authority.


Throughout the book I will provide examples of leaders and organizations that illustrate how important developing these skills can be. I will use the terms significant conversations and difficult conversations interchangeably. Both refer to situations where the parties in the conversation need to stay in a relationship, the stakes are high, opinions vary, and negative emotions are bubbling just below the surface and could boil over.


In recent years I have interviewed leaders from the corporate, law enforcement, military, and sports worlds—all of whom, without realizing it, engaged some of the positive response tactics tested and proven in the discipline of hostage negotiations. These techniques helped them to connect or feel connected to those within their environments. You can think of these examples as case studies to show how applicable and effective these principles are.


The ultimate goal of Ego, Authority, Failure is application. If you apply these skills, you will perform at a higher level. Whether you are a C-suite executive, midlevel manager, athletic coach, front-line supervisor, or human relations professional, this book was written for you. Each of you has some authority over or responsibility for someone else within your organization. Keeping the skills in this book at the top of your mind will vastly improve your interactions with them.


To get the most out of the book, use Parts I and II to acquaint yourself with key components of the HNL framework, along with the successes and failures of other leaders. Throughout the book I will share some case studies, allowing the stories to speak for themselves. These leaders’ and their organizations’ statuses are not as important as the lessons we all can learn from them. These are ordinary bosses who did the best and worst they could within their environments. Part III is focused on moving from understanding to action. The goal is for you to build the skills you need to improve your outcomes in significant conversations in the following ways:


 


• Improving your leadership performance by becoming a proactive, strategic, and intuitive listener.


 


• Establishing, maintaining, or repairing damaged superior–subordinate relationships.


 


• Managing your ego and authority.


 


• Navigating difficult conversations, change, and dissension.


 


• Increasing your proficiency in gathering information and influencing others.


 


These techniques were perfected by cops for cops. They are simple, readily available for recall, and effective because that is what cops want more than anything else. These techniques are designed to create what we call trust-based influence in order to motivate and inspire people to achieve unexpected, even extraordinary, results.


The principles and stories in this book are drawn from my own experiences and those of mid- to executive-level leaders. Others have been culled from open sources. Some of the people interviewed are still employed at the organizations in which they experienced leadership abuse of ego and authority. With the exception of the open-sourced individuals, names have been changed to honor the anonymity of those interviewed as well as the less-admirable leaders I highlight. The goal for me is not to focus on the individuals as much as their behavior. It is a mirror reflecting how you are seen by many of your subordinates and others—as arrogant, self-serving, inflexible, and petty. The stories of the toxic leaders in the book are not unique to any one space. You will recognize all of them based on your own experiences.


This book is for leaders who are in denial about the damage their ego and authority have on their organization. It is also for people who have the courage to make themselves better.

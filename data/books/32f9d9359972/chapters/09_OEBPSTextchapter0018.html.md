## The Action Imperative


 


It takes real commitment and discipline to lead with the HNL model.


The ego and authority model is so common that it is hard to break away from the negative influences it has on our decision-making in everyday life and high-stakes situations. Cultures that prioritize ego and authority often lead to micromanagement of subordinates, who need our trust to truly flourish.


Leaders who build trust are leaders who inspire action. The more trust you can establish, the more confidently you and your team will be able to assess risk, determine the best process, and make hard decisions. Ego-driven leadership tends to produce chaotic environments where a lack of trust leads to speculative decisions.


In law enforcement, the action imperative is when pressure from superiors to “get things moving” is exerted upon the people charged to manage the event. As you will see, this imperative can lead to dangerous situations where we attempt to wrest control from the hostage-taker without building trust.


 


### Pressure to Act


 


“We are going to do a hostage rescue.”


These are arguably the most ominous words spoken during a hostage-taking event.


Hostages are most likely to incur serious injury or death during the initial “taking” and during a rescue attempt. In other words, the hostage casualty rates increase significantly when we go in to save them. It is a striking dichotomy.


On one particularly memorable hostage-taking event that lasted twenty hours, the ego and authority of our Incident Commander (IC) clouded his judgment, placing us on the precipice of doing something that would likely cause irreparable damage.


In violation of a court order, David Kelly, a forty-eight-year-old carpenter, had taken his nine-year-old son, Sean, from his estranged wife, Dot, at gunpoint the night before outside her place of employment.


Dot Kelly placed their son inside her vehicle as she saw David approaching. David expressed his intent to take the boy home. Dot refused to let the child go with him, at which point he returned to his car and retrieved a handgun.


Dot fled, and David drove off in her car with Sean.


Dot immediately called the police. Responding officers searched David’s car, left near the location of the abduction, and found another pistol and a hatchet on the front passenger seat.


That evening, police obtained a warrant for his arrest, charging him with violation of the protective order. Officers went to the Kelly home and discovered Dot’s car in the driveway. They attempted to make contact with David but got no response.


Shortly thereafter, Sean called his grandmother in Florida and told her, “My daddy has a gun, and he will shoot anyone who tries to take me away from him.”


Multiple attempts to contact David proved fruitless. We spoke with him one time during the night. He said that everything Dot told us was a lie. He was with his son, in his house, and we would be better served leaving him alone.


As the sun came up, forward observers reported seeing the child clad in body armor inside the home. David was also seen propping a shoulder-fired weapon near the front door of the residence.


At about 6:30 a.m., we engaged Kelly in conversation for the first time since the “go away” exchange the night before. Although it was not the most productive of conversations, I viewed it as progress compared to nonexistent dialogue overnight.


Kelly called Sean’s godmother. He told her he wanted her to come to the home at 8:00 a.m. and take Sean to school. We obviously were not going to let her do that. At 8:15 a.m., he called the godmother again. This time we sent a negotiator to sit with her on the call.


We had vetted the godmother as an appropriate third-party intermediary (TPI) and used her as our “bullhorn” to communicate with Kelly. The negotiator acted as her coach and was listening in on the conversation between Kelly and her.


When Kelly was told that police would not let the TPI approach the house, he referred to us as “pigs” and said, “Do not tell me I am going to have to kill a cop.” Just before 8:30 a.m., another agency’s HNT took over for my team. It was time for them to get some rest. I stuck around until about 10:00 a.m., when I, too, was ordered to leave.


I should have left when my team did, but my own ego and authority got in the way. I returned to the scene at about 3:00 p.m. As I exited my vehicle, I could tell the tenor of the event had changed.


It is difficult to describe, but you know how, in the summertime before a storm, you can actually smell rain in the air though it has not arrived yet? The leaves on the trees start to flip over as the wind increases. The sun is still out but is beating a hasty retreat behind sinister-looking clouds. It was that kind of feeling.


On my way to the command post (CP), I walked past the robot control stand. Two of my negotiators were viewing the video feed from the bot, which had been positioned just to the left of the armored personnel carrier (APC) parked in front of Kelly’s house.


As I passed, I could see what had their attention. On the monitor there appeared to be a civilian, peeking around the back end of the APC, waving at the front of the home. This was wrong on many levels.


Why are we exposing a civilian to dangers we are not willing to expose our own personnel to? I thought as I continued to the CP.


I learned later that the other HNT was able to make sporadic contact with Kelly inside the residence by telephone while I was at home.


In these conversations, David sounded as if he was intoxicated. Negotiators speaking with him offered several opportunities to release his son and tried to convince him to surrender. Kelly stated that he would only release his son to the godmother or to his pastor if either came to his residence unescorted by police.


Again, this is not an option. The repeated pleadings with David to let his son leave were met with refusal. Throughout the day, Kelly repeated comments about how he might have to shoot a police officer to get what he wanted. He also confirmed that the shoulder-fired weapon observed by the sniper team earlier was indeed a shotgun.


About noon, David called his pastor (the civilian seen on the bot monitor) and asked him to come to his residence to talk to him. The team gave David the next best option and allowed him to continue talking with the pastor by phone, several times between noon and one o’clock.


During these conversations, David repeated his threats of shooting the police by asking if he would have to “start blowing pigs away” in order to prompt us into allowing a face-to-face conversation between him and the pastor. When the pastor informed Kelly that they would not let him approach the house out of concern for his safety, Kelly responded by saying, “If we cannot talk, we have a problem. It is a shoot ’em up problem is what it is. There is no choice.”


A negotiator engaged David by phone until just before my arrival. Additionally, officers and the pastor in the APC attempted to speak with Kelly directly by using a public address system from the vehicle.


Kelly shouted at one negotiator that he was going to “put one between his eyes.” Over the phone, he then threatened to shoot another negotiator because she “talked too much.”


Mental health experts monitored the situation from the beginning. They concluded early on that Kelly was suicidal. They also noted that Sean was the center of David’s life and he would not do anything to harm the boy unless someone tried to get in between the two.


It was also obvious David was drinking more alcohol as the day wore on. He occasionally ventured briefly onto his front porch to yell at the police. His gait and speech confirmed his alcohol consumption.


As I neared the CP, I could see my team supervisor, the one who had phoned me. This was odd. When I was not on-scene, she was supposed to be in the CP in my place. She was pacing back and forth outside of the bus.


It seemed that the senior executives saw fit to throw her off the bus.


Wait, what?


The senior executives’ egos led to deviation from policy.


They surmised she would pose resistance that they did not want to deal with as they contemplated their next actions.


My team supervisor at the time was Amy (who Mike Falconer referred to in Chapter 4). Amy is strong-willed, opinionated, extremely smart, and a great leader. She called it as she saw it, and that ruffled feathers, especially of those birds who outranked her.


I had worked with Amy at various times during my career. She is a consummate professional who demonstrates great decision-making and always creates an outstanding working environment for those who work for her. To this day, she is the best supervisor I have ever worked with and for. I would run through a wall for her. Her judgment and situational awareness are exemplary.


Leaders like Amy challenge leaders who are bound to ego and authority; their fear of the Amys of the world gets in the way of sound, logical judgment.


Authors Jocko Willink and Leif Babin wrote, “Ego clouds and disrupts everything: the planning process, the ability to take good advice, and the ability to accept constructive criticism.” This clouded vision was why Amy was not allowed to stay on the bus.


I opened the CP door. The chaos outside paled in comparison to what was going on inside. In my seat sat the commander of the other agency’s HNT. He rose when he saw me, walked past me, and said, “This is fucked up.”


I scanned the interior of the bus, which is not that big, and saw the chief of police, several other senior executives, the IC, and a host of others—far too many, according to protocol.


The Incident Command Triad, as the name implies, is supposed to be composed of three people: the IC, SOT (SWAT) Commander, and me. The SOT Commander and I served in a subordinate role to the IC, providing them with information from our respective teams so that they could make the appropriate decisions as to the resolution of the incident. The buck is supposed to stop with the IC. However, in this case, senior executives gave advice to IC in large part because they did not display much confidence in his ability to manage the incident.


They failed to empower him to make the right decisions. They second-guessed him, limited his responsibility, and micromanaged his tasks. They intentionally created a perception of autonomy while they maintained control over the incident. As observers of the IC, they directed him, primed him in how to act, and tried to dictate what he should do next. This is against policy, procedure, and practice.


In effect, they undermined his confidence, producing an environment in which he was reluctant to make a decision counter to what they were saying. I was floored and asked the IC what was going on.


“We are moving [a third agency’s SWAT team] up to relieve SOT so they can get some rest. We are going to do a hostage rescue.”


I asked what had changed in the time I was gone.


“He is suicidal.”


I told him we knew that in the morning. I begged the question with more firmness this time. “What…changed?” I asked, pausing slightly between words for effect.


He added, “We are not sure how much longer the kid will go unharmed.”


I reminded him what mental health had advised about David and Sean’s relationship. I asked again, “What…changed?”


He said, “We are concerned about the long gun behind the door.”


I told him we knew about the long gun earlier, asking again, “What…changed?”


He replied, “We are not gonna let this go into another night.”


At that time, I had been a lieutenant for about a year. Because I was a new lieutenant and the IC was a captain, me saying a hostage rescue was not the appropriate course of action did not sit well with him. I could see it on his face. I could see it on the faces of the other executives who were assisting him.


Here again is the power and influence of ego and authority. Senior-level law enforcement officials have offline discussions with the IC during the management of a hostage-taking. They should not be directly involved in planning and implementation. This is the reason they select and train individuals who are subject matter experts.


Yet, their ego tells them, You are an executive in this agency. You do not really have a responsibility here, but rather than just observing, go ahead and insert yourself into the process. That way you can validate yourself and your rank in front of your subordinates.


To his credit, the chief did not say much out loud while he was in the CP, but his mere presence changed the environment and affected the decision-making. Ego hindered his ability to see that. Ego and authority promoted consensual decision-making during this event. While it was never spoken, the IC quietly ceded authority for the decisions to others, causing the situation to spin out of control with collective rationalization, lack of accountability, and pressure to acquiesce. In other words, groupthink.


They failed to analyze and fully appreciate the potential risks of a hostage rescue because they had their own ideas as to the outcome. They floated those ideas looking for support. If they got the support, it validated them. Once validated, the ego was triggered. In the Kelly situation, the decision-making power was diffused, which set the stage for problems to develop.


When there is a clear definition of who has what responsibility for decision-making, the chances of something going wrong are reduced, particularly if the person is knowledgeable and experienced.


The “action criteria” was developed by the CNU at the FBI for hostage-taking events, and requires that before taking any tactical action that will alter the dynamics of the event, the IC must be able to answer the following questions:


 


• Why is the contemplated action necessary?


 


∘ What conditions changed to cause consideration of the action?


 


∘ Why are we taking action now?


 


• Why is the contemplated action risk-effective?


 


∘ Did we fully explore and attempt less-risky alternatives?


 


• Why is the contemplated action acceptable?


 


Clearly those who were running the show in my absence had not considered any of these questions or had chosen to ignore the conclusion. Here, ego and authority became impediments to making decisions in a highly stressed environment. Under the pressure of this event, risks were ignored because in their minds, consensus was better than conflict.


I reminded the IC that the two most critical times for a hostage are during the initial action and when we try to conduct a rescue. The SOT commander also voiced his concern about the proposed rescue. He agreed to call it off.


Remember, the action imperative takes hold when pressure from superiors to “get things moving” overwhelms proper management of the event. This is a dangerous proposition where we attempt to wrest control from the hostage-taker.


It usually ends in failure.


In this case, the emotions tied to ego and authority were so powerful that the IC and the rest of the decision-makers in the CP were seriously endangering life, merely to give David the impression that they were in control. But who was really in control? Think about it. If ego and authority are powerful enough to influence life-and-death decisions, how much more influence will they have on lower-stakes issues relating to the performance of your organization?


The IC whispered our veto to another executive in the CP. He then came back to me and said, “Well, we gotta do something to get a response out of him. Let’s send the robot up the porch steps to ‘break and rake’ a window and see what kind of response we get.”


I am not a tactical guy, but I do have some common sense. David was going to think it was an assault and kill either the kid and then himself or the bot. I shared my concern with the IC. His patience with me was starting to evaporate.


The SOT commander radioed his team as to what was being discussed. The response: “Hell no.”


Their fear was if the bot became disabled, it would be another obstacle they would have to work around if an emergency action became necessary.


And…boom goes the dynamite.


In the course of five minutes, actions the IC wanted to undertake were shot down by his subordinate team members. So the IC was now caught in between us telling him no, no, no and the bosses telling him go, go, go.


While the IC agreed to call off the hostage rescue and the bot going up the steps, he was still suffering from the effects of the action imperative. Ego and authority would not allow him to let it go. He wanted to do something to show everyone he was capable and in charge. He wanted to show David. He wanted to show me. He wanted to show the SOT commander. Perhaps more importantly, he wanted to show the other executives that he was in control.


There was a lot of conversation between the current IC, his relief, and other executives in the CP. They plaintively asked if they could use the bot to take a bullhorn up to the steps of the front porch and drop it in an attempt to coax Kelly from the house.


Since I had moved them from the extreme position of hostage rescue, using a bullhorn as bait was not going to get much pushback from me. Nor did any come from SOT because they had already formalized the plan to take Kelly into custody once he came down the steps.


A look of satisfaction came over the executives’ faces as they finally had an idea that was accepted.


Shortly before 4:30 p.m., the bot lumbered up the hill toward David’s house with the bullhorn in its claw. It navigated the curb and dropped the bullhorn at the base of the stairs, and then it backed up about ten feet.


The plan called for one element of SOT operators to deploy to a position where they might be able to shoot Kelly with a Sage gun. This tool fires large, less-lethal, hard rubber projectiles in order to stun a person, hopefully knocking him to the ground to make apprehension easier. Coincident with the use of the Sage gun, other operators would deploy noise-flash diversionary devices, otherwise known as “flash bangs,” designed to distract and disorient a person with a concussive explosion.


They hoped this would afford them an opportunity to rush David and subdue him without serious injury to him, Sean, or any of the officers.


The operators assigned to subdue David were prepared to use lethal force if his actions made that unavoidable. The plan also dictated that if they were able to lure David away from the house, under no circumstances would he be allowed to reenter the residence out of concern that he would harm his son or cause further confrontation.


David emerged from his residence and walked across the front porch. He sat down briefly on the top step leading to the sidewalk and then walked down the steps towards the bot. He was carrying a handgun in his right hand.


In a loud and commanding voice, the negotiator in the APC pleaded with David through a public address system to drop his weapon so as to warn other officers, who did not have the same vantage point. David disregarded these commands and descended the stairs. He picked up the bullhorn, which shattered in the street.


The sniper team radioed other members of the team who were concealed behind a vehicle parked in the driveway of the house next door and told them that David was armed with a handgun and had ventured far enough from the door of the residence that they could apprehend him.


At that time, the group of officers with the Sage gun began to move from behind the vehicle to the northwest corner of David’s residence to shoot him with the less-lethal weapon. Simultaneously, the other group, consisting of five officers, moved from behind the other end vehicle and started toward David to subdue him once the Sage weapon had been utilized.


They were nearly twenty-five feet from where he was standing pointing his pistol at the bot. There was no intervening cover, and a magnolia tree partially obscured the view of the approaching officers.


As the second group of officers drew closer to Kelly, he continued to face the bot and seemed oblivious to their presence nearby. The first element reached the corner of the house and determined that they had no clear shot at Kelly with the Sage gun, as their vision was obscured by a trellis, railing, and assorted junk that Kelly had allowed to accumulate on the front porch.


Before they could adjust and acquire a new firing position, a member in the second group bumped the vehicle behind which they had been hiding and set off the alarm.


David turned toward the officers in the second group.


At this point, about fifteen feet or less separated them. A lead operator in this group shouted at David repeatedly to drop his weapon. He failed to comply. Facing the operators in the second group, he began to raise his right arm, holding the gun in his right hand. These actions were relayed back to the CP via the bot video feed.


Then shots were fired.


An operator in the second group discharged a three-round burst from his MP5, .40 caliber weapon at David. One round struck him in the jaw and exited the back of his neck, severely wounding him. The other two rounds missed. Almost simultaneously, two flash-bangs were thrown toward Kelly and exploded nearby in his yard.


In spite of his wound, Kelly turned and walked toward the steps to his house. But whatever occurred next, Kelly would not be permitted to reenter the home.


A second operator fired two more rounds at Kelly, striking him in the right side of his abdomen. He collapsed on the front porch. Other operators entered the rear of the house, where they found and rescued Sean unharmed.


Officers rushed onto the porch and summoned medics, who were staged nearby. David Kelly was transported to the hospital, where he was pronounced dead.


We normally hold debriefings after any hostage-taking event. The David Kelly debrief was heated, as I will explain further in the next chapter.


 


### Takeaways


 


• Ego and authority produce emotions that negatively affect decision-making in life-and-death situations—and when the stakes are much, much lower too.


 


• Ego and authority can lead senior management to force their hand in operational situations, especially when they do not have confidence in their subordinates.


 


• Use the action criteria before taking an action that will change the situation. Simply ask yourself:


 


∘ Why is the contemplated action necessary?


 


∘ Why is the contemplated action risk-effective?


 


∘ Why is the contemplated action acceptable?


 


• Groupthink might be comfortable. But groupthink can get out of control and is difficult to predict due to a lack of accountability.


 


• Hasty action for the sake of action usually ends in failure.

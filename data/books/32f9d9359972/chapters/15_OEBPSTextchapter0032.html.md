## Accusations Audits and Negotiator Personality Types


 


Tactical Empathy sets a course that attacks negative emotions, impressions, assumptions, or opinions by demonstrating that you are trying to view things from the other person’s frame of reference. Because our attitudes are naturally influenced by negative emotions, learning a new language and behavior pattern that resets difficult conversations in a positive light is so important.


The Accusations Audit is another tool to create the right framework, ask the right questions, and use the right conversational posture in the right situation.


 


### Accusations Audit


 


How do differences inform our conversations? What negatives does the other side harbor that we want to deny, minimize, or eliminate?


Motivational speaker Tony Robbins says, “To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others.”


Tactical Empathy begins with the Accusations Audit (AA) to attack your counterpart’s negative emotion, impression, assumption, or opinion. As long as those negatives go unaddressed assess differences and guide our communications away from the negativity that can cloud our handling of difficult conversations.


How do you deliver AAs? This is a recommended blueprint. You are the ultimate arbiter as to what you actually say during your difficult conversations. That said, when considering AAs, go all in—meaning if you have ten, use all ten.


Here is the general outline of your difficult conversation.


Summary: Summarize the relationship from the beginning up to the current point in time. This could be something like, “Thank you for taking the time to attend this meeting. We have been working together for X, and you guys know you are very important to me and the overall mission of _______. We have been through Y. We have weathered a lot of successes and a few failures. All in all, you are some of the best that I have worked with.”


AA: Get out in front of the reaction.


 


• “You probably think that we are disorganized and we do not have a clear idea of the direction we want to go in.”


 


• “You may be thinking that this is punitive in some way.”


 


• “You might think that we are trying to make our jobs easier by making yours harder.”


 


Why? Ask a why question, if applicable, to get them to support your position.


 


• “Why do you want to work for our agency?”


 


• “Why would you ever consider joining my team?”


 


AA: Hit them with one or two more right before you get to your ask idea, core idea, or bad news. At the very least you should throw out, “This is going to sound horrible.”


Case in chief: This is where you make your ask, state your objective, or resolve the issue.


The following example does not involve a superior–subordinate relationship, but you will be able to imagine a similar circumstance in your environment.


 


### Making the Ask


 


In September 2016, a fellow negotiator at the FBI and I were having a conversation in which he was relaying his experience at a two-week hostage negotiation school he attended in Spain. There he met Claudette, a negotiator from France’s primary national counterterrorism force, Recherche, Assistance, Intervention, Dissuasion (RAID). RAID’s practices in hostage negotiation have a lot in common with the Bureau’s Hostage Rescue Team (HRT).


Claudette had been involved in two major terrorist events, one in 2015 at the Bataclan Theater in Paris and the other in 2016 in the town of Magnanville, about thirty-four miles west of Paris. Tate, my FBI friend, said it would be valuable if we could find a way to get Claudette to the United States to share her experiences with US negotiators.


I agreed and asked how he was going to do it. He worried that routing a request like this through the Bureau would be the equivalent of trying to run through mud eighteen inches deep. He thought it would be easier to go through the Washington Metropolitan Area Council of Governments (COG). Turned out, it was not.


At the time I was the vice chair of the newly formed negotiator’s subcommittee at COG that had yet to establish a training fund. The cost to get Claudette to the United States for three days was estimated to be in the neighborhood of $10,000. A representative at COG told me that the more tenured SWAT subcommittee was sitting on close to $80,000 in unspent training funds that had been available for nearly three years.


He gave me the contact information for the SWAT subcommittee chair, and I reached out. Irwin, the chair and a state trooper for the Virginia State Police, agreed that it sounded like a great idea but said that he could not make a decision of this magnitude unilaterally. I would have to address the entire group of SWAT operators who represented the twenty-four member agencies of COG. He put me on the agenda to speak at their next meeting.


So far, so good.


The relationship between SWAT operators and negotiators historically has not been warm and fuzzy. There was a time when you could ask a SWAT operator what their impression of a negotiator was, and they would reply with names like a mouth marine, tree hugger, or give-peace-a-chance nut. “All they want to do is talk about feelings.”


If you were to ask a negotiator the same question about SWAT guys, you would hear things like Velcro-wearing, tobacco-dipping door kickers. “All they want to do is shoot people and break things.”


Most people would say that each team’s mission, when it comes to hostage-barricade management, is diametrically opposed to the other’s. This misconception was prevalent for many years. Thankfully, some of those misconceptions have changed. But there is still an “us versus them” specter in the air.


Prior to the meeting I prepared a list of AAs:


 


• “Some of you do not hold negotiators in the highest regard.”


 


• “You guys think of me as an interloper.”


 


• “You probably think I am here for an unwarranted money grab.”


 


• “You are probably questioning my audacity at coming in here to ask for something that I had no part in generating.”


 


• “You may question the value of this type of training.”


 


• “Some of you may take offense at my being here.”


 


• “You may even think I am just being greedy.”


 


• “My being here is probably a complete waste of your time.”


 


These are the negative opinions, assumptions, and impressions I thought they might convey in response to me and my message.


The day came, and I showed up at the appointed time. As I approached the doorway to the conference room, I could hear the banter. When I entered the room, the banter reduced significantly. All eyes were on me. I took a cold read of the room, scanning to see if my AAs were on point.


I noticed a guy staring at me while leaning back in his chair. His facing said, “Why are you even here?” I saw two other guys sitting together. One leaned toward the other and whispered something. They both then looked at me and smirked.


My AAs were right on point.


The meeting was called to order. I listened to some of the old business, and then it was on to the new. I was at the top of the list. I stated all of my AAs and followed them with a summary of why I was there. One guy in the audience spoke: “I, like everyone in this room, like case studies, but if we were to vote for this, it would set a precedent.”


“Precedent?” I Mirrored.


“Yeah. We usually use that training money for more tangible things like explosives and sniper training. We do not use it to fly people in to talk.”


“Sounds like you are questioning the value of this case study.” Here, I used a Label.


“No, no, no. It sounds interesting, but I, for one, am worried that if we approve this, we are obligating ourselves to do it for other subcommittees, like K-9.”


I told them I could not speculate on what the K-9 subcommittee would do but assured them this was a one-time ask for us. Our intention was to begin soliciting the chief of police group for a training fund similar to what they had in place, but arranging that for this venture would take more time than we had.


I concluded my presentation and thanked them for the opportunity. Two days later, Irwin emailed me and said the group had approved our request for $10,000.


Whenever you are going to engage anyone in a difficult conversation, the AA shows that you are attempting to appreciate their point of view. It is worth repeating: the AA reduces the chance of using negatives against you. It allows them to focus on your message rather than the negative reaction that might be going on internally, which will expedite your ability to build rapport.


If you do not address the negatives before getting to your objective, the negativity will be bouncing around their heads because of the brain’s natural reactive biases. While our negative biases help keep us alive by helping us avoid danger, they can also keep us from making progress in key life moments and relationships. AAs are designed to eliminate the negatives and help set the framework for moving the conversation forward. As highlighted in the SWAT committee example, using AAs at the beginning of your difficult conversation will pave the way for a better outcome.


Do not be afraid to skip the pleasantries and small talk and jump right into an AA to attack the negatives. These negatives are the product of fear. As long as there is a remote feeling of fear or that you are a threat, dialogue is less likely to take place and lead in a positive direction.


You are a smart person. You know your employees and coworkers well enough that you can probably predict the emotion or response you are likely to receive. It gives you a tremendous advantage when you address the negatives before you get into presenting your case.


 


### Assertives, Accommodators, Analysts


 


Most of us view ourselves as cerebral, logical, and smart. One of the most debilitating assumptions that we make is that we are “normal” and that others are not. Our hypothesis is that the world should look to our employees as it looks to us. We believe they want to be treated the way we want to be treated.


Stop it!


Do not treat them the way you want to be treated. Treat them as they want to be treated. Because there are three “negotiator” personality types within the Black Swan Method, two out of three employees or coworkers you deal with see themselves as the “normal” one, not you. This means there is a minimum 66 percent chance the person you engage within a difficult conversation has an approach to conflict vastly different from yours.


When we think “I am normal,” we unconsciously project our own ideals and sensibilities on other people, including our employees.


For example, you say to yourself that because you like pepperoni pizza, others should also like pepperoni pizza. It only makes sense, right? Pepperoni is delicious!


Wrong!


What is “normal” is unique to the individual.


Recognizing which type you are and the type you are dealing with will help you appreciate their definition of “normal.”


At the BSG, we have conducted an exercise for businesspeople all over the globe. The exercise involves exposing them to our three negotiator personality types. Then, upon introspection, they place themselves into one of the categories. Without fail we have found that each group splits fairly neatly into thirds.


The first type is strongly predisposed to being heard and respected and competing to win at all costs. They have an aggressive communication style and low regard for future relationships.


The second type gets tremendous satisfaction from relationships. Having others like them is more important than accomplishments.


The third type is a reserved problem-solver, more concerned with data and information. They do not slink away from conflict, but they consider it largely a waste of time. Tell them what the issue is, and they would much prefer to fly solo in coming up with a solution.


Let’s take a look at each more closely.


 


### Identifying Their Type


 


How do you identify each type? When you have skin in the game, the pressure is on, or you feel you are getting backed into a corner or attacked, what is your default type? As I lay out the characteristics of each, consider which best fits your human-nature response.


Here is a story that may help you decide which one you are.


Imagine your conflict is a giant grizzly bear. You are hiking in the woods and come across this bear. He is sitting on the path you are walking on. You see him. He sees you. The Assertive unsheathes a large hunting knife and says to herself, “I may not win this one, but at the end, this bear is going to know he has been in a fight.”


The Analyst pulls out his GPS unit and begins to scroll through the different escape paths off the main one that he entered prior to the hike for an emergency like this. He ducks behind a tree, selects a path, and moves deeper into the bush. He finds a tree to climb, removes a rifle from his pack, and shoots the bear from a distance.


The Accommodator approaches the bear with arms extended and says, “There, there, little fella. You know what your problem is? No one understood you as a cub. I am gonna take you home, clean you up, and introduce you to my family.” Understanding your negotiator conflict management personality is critical to navigating difficult conversations.


I am not suggesting you should or can change your personality. You are who you are. Your response to push back, attack, or flee is a part of your makeup.


The goal is not to change you. The goal is to make you aware of who you are and what the other two look like so you can borrow from the other two camps and make yourself better at interpersonal communications.


Recognize what style the other party adopts and how you should respond.


Understand that your strengths could be your greatest weakness.

### Accusations Audit Table


 












Assertives
Accommodators
Analysts


1
Many of you will find yourselves in this category. Several have been highlighted in this book. What is as important for the Assertive as resolving the issue? Being heard and respected.
What is as important for the Accommodator as resolving the issue? Likability and maintaining relationships. If there is no resolution of the issues discussed, they are okay with it as long as they leave on good terms.
What is as important for the Analyst as resolving the issue? Confirming the facts and information they already have.


2
Think of themselves as among the smartest people in the room.
Cannot move forward unless the relationship is good.
Readily conceal information.


3
View themselves as logical, straightforward, and goal-oriented. They say, “I want to talk to you so you can understand my logic.”
Get satisfaction from solving others’ problems.
Suspicious of motivations behind questions if there is no preexisting relationship. They ask themselves, Why did you ask me that?


4
The most inflexible.
The most aware of equity. Take a hard look at the other side’s perspective of to make sure they are treating them fairly.
Like to agree in principle, but that does not mean the issue is resolved. They have agreed to think about it. Their yes is usually a maybe.


5
Tunnel vision when trying to reach goals, which usually leads to missed opportunities. Have decided where they want to end up. There is no range of options.
When you are being a jerk, Accommodators will not tell you because they do not want to offend you. Tell you you are right even when they are not buying into what you are saying for the same reason.
Do not like to be pushed or led, so how do you get them to open up? Engage them in comparative analysis. They love to explain the rationale for how they got to where they are.


6
No cost is too high for the win. Do not leave the room until a resolution has been reached.
Good use of time is conversation. If they are in a friendly conversation and building or maintaining a relationship, they are being productive.
Take as much as is necessary to get it right. While Assertives want a yes and do not care about the how, Analysts do not work like that. They want the how. Time is also an opportunity to think. When thinking, they fall silent.


7
Do not display empathy but are highly vulnerable to it.
More attuned to kinesics and verbal signals.
High tolerance for assertive, hard-nosed discussions. They tend to overprepare, lining up facts, data, and information.


8
Not the same as aggressive, but because they have a direct style of communication that they employ aggressively, people equate assertion with aggression. To Assertives, directness provides less opportunity for miscommunication.
Hypersensitive to how they deliver their message. The last thing they want to do is to say something negative that could upset another person. If pushed on something or asked to agree to something where they have no authority, body language shows their hesitancy (nothing verbal).
Do not fear interpersonal conflict or heated discussion of objectives, but they do view it as a waste of time.


9
Will not stab you in the back. Prefer to walk up and bury the knife in your chest so they can see the look in your eyes.
Beholden to the white lie. One Accommodator told us, “We are not intentionally lying to you, but you cannot believe everything that we say.” They want to make you happy, so they agree to everything. They even overpromise and agree to something they cannot implement because in the moment they want to appease you or they want to be fair.



10
When a conversation goes bad or is unproductive and you ask them what went wrong, they say they were not assertive enough.
When a conversation goes bad or is unproductive and you ask them what went wrong, they say they did not focus enough on the relationship.
When a conversation goes bad or is unproductive and you ask them what went wrong, they say they either did not have enough information or the other side failed to see the logic.


11
Do not appreciate the currency of an apology. It implies they did something wrong.
They appreciate the currency of an apology, both in giving and receiving.



12
Assertives and Analysts are two sides of the same coin. Therefore, Assertives hate dealing with Analysts and vice versa. Love dealing with Accommodators because Accommodators are so focused on the relationship that they will get beaten up for a while, which is right up the Assertives’ alley.
Enjoys working with the two other types, to a point.
Both Analysts and Assertives view themselves as logical. The problem is logic is often based on your frame of reference. If you think you are logical, and I think I am logical, yet we do not agree, somebody’s facts are wrong. Instead of logical, pragmatic is a better descriptor for the Analysts.


13
Because they love to talk, the technique of Silence has less of an effect on them because you shutting up means you want them to continue talking.
Silence makes them nervous. When they are met with it, they immediately ask themselves what went wrong. What is the problem? What did I do? Did I offend them? Maybe I need to apologize.
Should make their use of Silence a part of their AA. When talking to an Assertive, the Analyst should say something like, “This is going to sound stupid. I tend to fall silent during conversations. It is not that I necessarily want you to continue talking. I do it to further process what was just said.” When talking to an Accommodator, the Analyst should say something like, “This is going to sound horrible. I tend to fall silent during conversations. It does not mean that you have upset me or made me angry. I do it to further process what was just said.” Note the deliberate use of the words “stupid” for the Assertive and “horrible” for the Accommodator. They are likely the adjectives that each thinks of often.


14
When it comes to reciprocity, once you give in to the Assertive, they are not satisfied. They count the seconds until you give them something else. “I got a piece, and I want more.”
The most reciprocal of the three types.
Least reciprocal of the three in large part because they think of reciprocity as a trap. If you make a concession for an Analyst that they were not prepared for or did not factor into their thinking in some way, their first thought is, Something has got to be wrong with this. On the other hand, they do not give anything up unless they have thought about it long and hard. They do not give it up because it means something to you. They do not give up because you have laid out unbeatable logic. They offer concessions only when it makes sense to them.


15
Take nothing personal during a heated discussion. They will argue vehemently and then go for a beer with the other person afterward.
Can be vicious in certain situations. Once they recognize there is no relationship to be developed or their tolerance level for being burned has been reached, they can be very aggressive.
Autonomous. If they can do it by themselves, they will.


16
Coming to a resolution or gaining compliance is more important than future relationships. Respect is more important than resolution or compliance.
Maintaining the relationship is more important than compliance or resolution.
View relationships as something to be managed but not the most important thing.


17
Attorneys, investment bankers, venture capitalists, surgeons, and car salespeople are where you can find Assertives.
Social workers, teachers, and counselors are where you can find Accommodators.
IT professionals, entrepreneurs, and engineers are where you can find Analysts.


18
The best tools for having difficult conversations with Assertives: Mirrors help them to connect their thoughts. They come in talking to make you understand. Use Mirrors to help them get their thoughts out for clarity. Mirrors also feed their egos since the words you Mirror are their own. They love the way they sound. CQs: What and how questions feed their need to talk. Summarize: Let them know you are picking up what they are laying down. Try to get a “that is right” out of them.
The best tools for having difficult conversations with Accommodators: CQs: Use what and how questions to focus on implementation. Maybe they have not been as candid because they do not want to upset the relationship. What and how questions give them permission to open up.
The best tools for having difficult conversations with Analysts: Labels: Use Labels that focus on comparative analysis. “It seems like you have put a lot of effort into coming up with an alternative solution.” “It looks like you have a really good handle on this.” It is not confrontational, and you recognize their problem-solving ability and their ability to focus on the facts.

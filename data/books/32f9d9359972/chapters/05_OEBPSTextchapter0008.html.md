## People First


 


Hostage Negotiator Leadership (HNL) requires a people-first approach and asks us to subordinate ourselves to the person we are in conversation with. This might not fit in with most of what we have heard about leadership or with many organizations that think they have it all figured out. But it is an approach that will open leaders to a life of learning committed to authenticity, transparency, and empathy.


Theories of leadership abound, from business schools to corporate training organizations. But business schools do not spend nearly enough time preaching (teaching) the virtues of empathy, so their graduates enter the workforce with self-serving attitudes. Similarly, many CEOs say empathy is important, but data shows there is a lack of interpersonal communication skills training within organizations. This coupled with what is going on in business schools creates fertile ground for toxic leadership.


Nelson Mandela once said, “A leader is like a shepherd. He stays behind the flock, letting the most nimble go out ahead, whereupon the others follow, not realizing that all along they are being directed from behind.” The HNL model takes this wisdom, creating an environment where you ultimately improve the lives of your employees and keep them engaged and committed to the mission.


I have seen firsthand how the HNL’s people-first mindset can play out.


 


### Subordinating Yourself


 


Here is a real-life example of what can happen when we put others first.


The Cash Store pawnshop was located in a strip mall we affectionately dubbed “Hostage Row,” having been the scene of previous hostage-takings. It sat on King Street in Alexandria, Virginia, on the border with Arlington County.


The hostage-taker’s name was Mike. Mike enlisted the help of a buddy, Steve, to rob the pawnshop. They drove to the strip mall and parked a few spots down from the front of the business. Both exited the car and donned ski masks. Mike produced a handgun as they entered the business and announced the robbery to the five customers and three employees.


Their day went downhill from there.


When they entered the pawnshop, a twelve-year-old boy was riding his bike to the Five Guys hamburger joint located in Hostage Row just around the corner from the pawnshop. He reported what he saw to the manager of the Five Guys, who called the police. Two units were parked nearby and responded in less than ninety seconds.


The units approached the rear of the business with weapons drawn. Using a trash compactor for cover, one officer, Jeff, pointed his shotgun at the rear of the business. The other, Adrienne, was at a ninety-degree angle on Jeff’s left, pointing her service weapon at the door. As Jeff got on the radio to coordinate the other officers’ response, the back door of the pawnshop flew open, and there stood Mike and Steve. Jeff was surprised to see them. They were surprised to see him. Jeff challenged Mike and Steve: “Police! Don’t move!” Mike responded by slamming the door shut.


The hostage-taking was on.


Dana, the founder of our hostage negotiation team (HNT), built our team out of nothing and made it into one of the preeminent HNTs in the Washington metropolitan area. He had reached the stage in his career where he was teaching more than negotiating, but on this day he found himself as the primary negotiator in a very dangerous incident.


It had been almost ten years since we had had a hostage-taking of this scope, and in that one, we lost two officers.


Nerves were on edge.


Dana called the pawnshop’s phone. When Mike eventually picked up, Dana embodied the HNL model, immediately deferring in conversation.


“Hey. My name is Dana, I—”


“Look, man, do not come in here. If you all do anything foolish, these people gonna get hurt, man! Blood is gonna be on your hands.”


“Nobody is coming in there. Okay? You have my word on that. We just wanna make sure you are okay. What happened? How did we get here today?”


From the very start, Dana conveyed to Mike that this event was about him. Not the hostages. Not the police. Of course, Dana’s ultimate goal was to get Mike to release the hostages and surrender, but he did not mention or focus on that during the initial dialogue. It was all about demonstrating for Mike that we understood his worldview even if we were not in agreement with his current actions.


By subordinating himself to Mike, Dana showed more concern for Mike than anything else. The result? Mike admitted that his name was not Mike. It was Keith. Dana returned Keith to a (more) normal functioning level where he began to see the hostages had nothing to do with his current circumstances. After an hour he released the first group. Shortly thereafter he released the remaining hostages before killing himself.


Dana earned trust that was key to achieving the release of the hostages. It is counterintuitive for most people to ignore their objectives during difficult conversations, but Dana knew the power in these subtle overtures. With two questions, he put Keith first, and that move would pay big dividends before the end of the incident.


Putting your people before yourself will likewise pay big dividends in your role as a leader.


 


### Humility and Sincerity


 


Retired United States Army Colonel William Montgomery III is a senior lead technologist for a major defense contracting firm. In 2007, he wrote a strategy research project paper entitled, “Beyond Words: Leader Self-Awareness and Interpersonal Skills.”


As a major in 2001, Montgomery worked for a battalion commander who told him that effective leadership went beyond the army doctrine of “listen to your leaders, do not ask a lot of questions, move out, and get the mission done.” He told Montgomery effective leadership was about taking care of your people.


Both Montgomery and the battalion commander agreed that the Army was not doing the best it could when it came to connecting with people. Montgomery was encouraged to attend a leadership training course at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. The battalion commander said the course would shake him up a bit and be invigorating before Montgomery became a battalion commander.


When Montgomery approached his direct supervisor about attending the course, he did not receive an immediate favorable response. “Why are you going to Leavenworth to learn what you have been learning in the military for the last eighteen years? You already know leadership. Why do you want to be a part of a civilian course when you have had these deployment experiences?” Montgomery explained his reasons, and his supervisor granted permission for him to attend.


The fourteen days he spent at Fort Leavenworth allowed him to compare and contrast current civilian leadership training with that of the army. There were twenty-five people in the class, all civilians except for Montgomery. The course was mandated for army civilian employees if they wanted to get promoted to a GS-14 or higher. The facilitators worked with them through what he called “the experience,” which allowed them to self-assess and take stock of their ability to interact with individuals they had never met before.


The class was together twelve to fourteen hours a day, including weekends. It took this group of total strangers through the four stages of team development, and at times the road of “the experience” was quite bumpy.


Montgomery reported instances where the conflict bubbled to the surface and fights nearly broke out. More than once he questioned his rationale for being there.


This was actually a part of the plan. The facilitators explained that allowing conflict to play out in the learning environment was a necessity. They would see this type of conflict in the real world, so it was something the facilitators were not willing to stifle.


After the course, Montgomery was indeed invigorated, and he took with him leadership lessons of “the experience” as he continued on his way to becoming a battalion commander.


To bolster the training received at Leavenworth, the facilitators offered to conduct mini-workshops for the class participants once they returned to their regular duty stations. Montgomery took them up and invited one of them to Japan to deliver a three-day workshop to a group of people he had never met: his new battalion.


The workshop was structured in a way that it took all the noncommissioned officers (NCOs) and civilian leadership away from the battalion for three full days. There were murmurings about how the training would adversely impact them, with so much of the leadership missing for three days. Many said Montgomery was foolish for making the attempt and would not likely recover if the training indeed disrupted operations.


“It is interesting,” Montgomery said, “that 90 percent of the folks I talked to, who were my peers, who were also going into this experience, immediately told me, ‘Bill, do not do this. You do not need to.’”


Fortunately, the facilitator he met at Leavenworth was encouraging. He said, “Look, Bill, this is exactly what you are going to hear. This is exactly what you heard as you rose through the ranks. So you have got two choices. You can either go with your gut because you have experienced this and trust that this will do more for your group, or you can forget about it and chalk it up as a great experience for yourself. Unfortunately, if you do that, you are not really going to be able to empower the folks you are actually there to lead, and you are not gonna gain anything.”


Another piece of advice the facilitator gave to Montgomery was to take his newly discovered trusting and transparent leadership style and apply it with vigor during his first seventy-two hours on the base.


“If you do,” the facilitator said, “you will learn things about the organization, yourself, and the leaders you have now taken under your wing.”


Unfortunately, most leaders do not take the time to learn about the people within their organizations until they are six or seven months in. By then, it is usually too late because they have become so mired in the obstacles, tasks, and requirements of their new position that they do not have the time to discern what is really going on with their personnel.


Two weeks prior to his new assignment in Japan, Montgomery was still undecided as to whether to execute the three-day training. He was afraid he was going to blow it. However, he knew the value of the program. He knew leaders do not get many opportunities at experiences like this. Intuition told him to go with the training, but his head was telling him he was a new battalion commander in a foreign country. You are taking a huge risk, dummy. He wrestled with the decision for a few days but ultimately went with his gut.


Montgomery changed command on a Friday. The facilitators went to work the same day, conducting interviews through the weekend. They interviewed all the senior leadership, asking thought-provoking questions: “How are things going?” “What are some things you would like to see change?” “How do you feel?”


The first session started at eight o’clock Monday morning and continued through Wednesday. The facilitator told him he needed to display sincerity and authenticity, adding, “Leaders go first. Good leaders are transparent, and that is the way you have got to go into this group. You need to be very authentic. The first hour you are with them, you want the rest of the group to believe that what they are seeing is real. It is not some kind of an experiment.” He sat down with the group, subordinated himself, and then shared the story of his two weeks in Leavenworth.


The civilians in attendance had served under five or six different commanders. What they were being exposed to as the training got underway was in stark contrast to what they were accustomed to, but they gave it a chance because of Montgomery’s humility and sincerity. He told them, “I really believe this will do great things for you. Not only as a unit but in your marriage, social life, community, whatever. It is going to stay with you.”


Initially, everybody looked around at each other, confused, as if to ask what they were doing there.


Eventually, there came a revelation, and by close of business Wednesday, Montgomery knew he had hit the mark.


His most vivid memory was of a command sergeant major who was an E-9 with twenty-seven years in the military. He broke down in tears at the end of the final group session where they were sitting in a circle and reflecting on the three-day journey they had undertaken. The reasons for the E-9’s tears were both joy and relief. He said he was unaware of the way the team viewed his wife.


Montgomery said, “Wives play a big part in organizations, and apparently the sergeant major’s wife was so involved in the organization that she kind of wore the rank of her husband, and that was a barrier for many of the soldiers.”


The E-9 basically said, “I am so thankful that we took this approach because I learned things about myself as well as my wife and, more importantly, how to help the group in ways I never would have. There is still time to turn it into a positive when it comes to listening and being more authentic as opposed to just thinking everything is going fine.”


As good as the workshop was, Montgomery’s job was not done. The facilitator told him that if he wanted this organizational leadership experience to stick, he should allow them to come back in six and then twelve months for progress evaluations. Montgomery agreed.


Each time, they conducted a barometer reading: “Here is what you said you were going to accomplish. Here is where you are at the six-month mark based on feedback that we have gotten from your group, and here is where you are at the twelve-month mark.”


For Montgomery, it was good to see some calibration telling them they were on track.


Montgomery was then selected to attend the War College, where he chose a thesis for a research and writing project that eventually became Beyond Words, focusing on what the US Army was getting wrong when it came to leadership.


“We [the army] write a lot of great documents,” Montgomery said. “We think we are the best leaders in the world, and we have got some great leadership techniques. But I think we are missing one essential mark, which is we are really not as connected to our people as we should be.”


The consequences of this disconnection were devastating. Soldier suicide. Conflicts within families. Conflicts within units. Montgomery knew that the army could get ahead of these issues if leaders were strong enough not to view Tactical Empathy as a touchy-feely technique but a core talent they must comprehend and employ.


The amount of productivity, transparency, honesty, and trust that would permeate throughout the organization “would just be beyond belief, and we were losing that opportunity if we continued to operate as we were.”


Notwithstanding, Montgomery continued dealing with nonbelievers.


When he brought the concept of the paper to his staff advisor at the War College, someone who had a background in psychology, he was told, “Bill, I do not see what you are seeing. This is really not gonna make any difference. You are kind of wasting your time while you are here if you are going to put [effort] into this area because the army has already figured this out.”


Ironically, as the years wore on, US Army’s Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) undertook several studies in which they interviewed middle-grade officers and NCOs. Most reported that their leaders were not in touch with their frame of reference, which led to many of them leaving the service.


They would say, “I am passionate about what the army does, but I just cannot operate in an environment where one, my leaders are not authentic and two, I feel like I can do something more than how they are boxing me in at the moment.”


Interestingly, the same relational results have been found between coaches and athletes.


 


### Athletics


 


Bo Hanson understands the importance of putting the needs of people on par with the needs of the organization. Bo is the Director and Senior Coaching Consultant of Athlete Assessments for the University of Technology Sydney in Queensland, Australia. In 1992, he became Australia’s youngest rower to compete in the Olympics. He went on to win bronze medals in 1996, 2000, and 2004. Hanson regularly speaks about athlete-centered coaching, leadership, teamwork, and how to use behavioral profiling and EQ to create greater success.


Hanson was fortunate that he had a coach through three Olympics who had a collaborative style. The coach had very specific ideas of how to achieve high performance, yet he also understood the need to engage athletes to keep them involved and contributing to the success of the program.


This collaborative approach involved regular discussions about what worked and what did not and frequent feedback sessions to bounce ideas off one another. They functioned as a cohesive unit, developing trust that lasted for many years.


Hanson said, “If I do not connect with my players, it is a reason for them to potentially leave the program or at least completely disengage from the program. They are seeing now that relationships within the sporting scene are in fact a performance factor. It actually is a competitive advantage.”


And for all intents and purposes, it is free. Consider the amount of money that sports spend on facilities, equipment, and travel. “To have a better relationship just takes…well, it just takes empathy, but that is not easy for some coaches to do.”


Hanson pointed to the 2008 Summer Olympic Games in Beijing, China. During these Olympics, Canadian athletes won twenty medals, making it the country’s second-best nonboycotted Summer Olympics ever, behind the twenty-two they won at Atlanta in 1996. Hanson believes Canada’s performance should be attributed to the effective and productive relationship between coach and athlete.


Those who returned with a medal or had personal-best performances (including Ian Miller, who, at age sixty-one and after nine Olympic appearances, won his first medal) did so because of that connection. What does it all mean? It all but confirms the positive relationship an athlete has with their coach is a performance factor. However, this message is only now starting to gain traction within the coaching communities.


Many coaches and leaders make the mistake of failing to put people first. Often coaches come to work with Hanson’s groups because their methods to this point have failed. If they do not improve their performance, their job, if not their career, is in jeopardy.


Even after Hanson’s counsel, some cannot make the change. For others, the change in their behavior has been significant. They have made the conscious decision to make themselves vulnerable by opening themselves up to their players, and as the student-athletes reciprocate, a closeness develops. It is a new way of thinking and a different way to operate, especially for older coaches. Older coaches did not have coaches who were like that, so they do not have a role model to emulate. That is part of the challenge.


The new generation of athletes, now more than ever, is not interested in dictatorial or autocratic coaching. Hanson recounted a recent conversation with an NCAA Division I basketball coach who said athlete transfer lists are growing astronomically every year as they decide they no longer want to be a part of programs where there is a lack of empathy.


If they do not like something about a program, they do not hang around for the long term as in years past. They look at other options, and rules are being bent or perhaps even rewritten to facilitate this. But Hanson has also worked with programs where the athletes would never transfer out because they feel like they have a deep sense of ownership and belonging in the program. The leaders of these programs adopt the mindset of the primary caregiver. Whether the primary caregiver is a manager, schoolteacher, parent, or coach, to get the best out of the people they are responsible for they need to create an atmosphere where each member actually feels involved and enjoys what they are doing.


Creating an environment where you have highly engaged people is as important in athletics as it is in hostage negotiation. Coaches who engage in HNL principles develop deeper relationships with their athletes and not only influence the athletes in the context of how they perform but actually have a profound impact on their lives.


 


### Takeaways


 


• HNL requires that you subordinate yourself to the person you are speaking with in a difficult conversation. This is awkward and counterintuitive, but it pays off.


 


• Transparency shows you are authentic. The sooner you demonstrate transparency with your direct reports, the sooner they will demonstrate the same with you and others.


 


• HNL means creating an environment where collaboration and empathy produce a sense of ownership for everyone. Connection and ownership within your teams create an atmosphere where motivation and productivity thrive.

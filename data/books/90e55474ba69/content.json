The author shares his personal journey, highlighting the limitations of conventional real estate training and the transformative impact of Chris Voss's negotiation techniques. The chapter argues for a shift from the 'agent's doom loop' of chasing, convincing, and closing to a more authentic and effective approach based on understanding and addressing clients' emotional needs.",

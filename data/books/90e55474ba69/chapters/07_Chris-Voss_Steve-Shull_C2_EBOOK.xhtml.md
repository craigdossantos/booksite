##### Chapter 2.  The Favorite or the Fool


It’s not a sin to lose business—it’s a sin to take a long time to lose business.


Once upon a time in a magical, mystical real estate market, there lived an incredible real estate agent.


She was truly on top of her game.


She cultivated the right mindset, built strong relationships, and outworked everyone. Everything in her business was buttoned up tight and state of the art. She was the personification of best practices for a real estate professional.


One day, she received a phone call from a potential seller who asked her to come out and give a listing presentation. It was the perfect opportunity for the agent—this property and client fit her ideal profile for doing business.


The agent prepared everything diligently, as always. She dropped off a pre-listing package, confirmed the appointment in advance, and arrived on time, ready to go with a big smile and positive attitude. It was show time!


The meeting could not have gone more perfectly. The prospective sellers listened to everything she said, seemed very engaged, and asked very specific questions. Their attention never faded during the two-hour presentation.


The sellers thanked the agent profusely and commented on how impressed they were with everything she had shared. They said with a big smile, “You’ve given us so much to think about. Let us process everything, and we’ll get back to you shortly.”


The agent left the meeting on cloud nine. She desperately wanted this listing, and knew she was the best person for the job. Given that the appointment had gone even better than expected, it seemed like a sure thing. She started going through her database mentally, thinking of who she might show the property to. This was going to be fun, not to mention a great paycheck.


The next day, the phone rang. It was the seller on the line, and the agent’s heart started beating rapidly in anticipation of good news…that never came.


The sellers shared again how grateful they were for all the information the agent had presented, but they had decided to work with someone else. The agent was in shock, and could barely say thank you for the call. She hung up the phone in absolute disbelief.


This made no sense. She had done everything right from start to finish. She was the obvious choice. What could have possibly happened? Did she say something wrong? Did she totally misread the situation?


This is the story of the Favorite and the Fool.


This version involves made-up people in a nonexistent place, but you already know it’s a true story because it has happened to you (probably more times than you can count). And if you’re like most agents, you’re still wondering what you did wrong.


Just one thing: you assumed you actually had a shot in the first place.


You probably think I’m crazy for saying that. Of course you had a shot! Why else would they have called you and asked for a listing presentation?


What you’re about to learn is that not all opportunities are created equal. Sometimes you have a high probability of doing business with a prospective client—you’re the Favorite. Other times (far too often), you’re the Fool. Someone else is already the Favorite, and you’re just there for due diligence…wasting your time on work that will never lead to a deal, no matter what you say or do.


The key to building a great business is learning to tell the difference between possibility and probability. Fools chase possibilities. To be the Favorite, you have to focus on probabilities.


The concept of the Favorite and the Fool is the main organizing principle in this book. Everything else flows from this fundamental distinction. How you approach your real estate business (and the results you get from it) will change dramatically once you embrace this reality.


This is a tough pill for most agents to swallow. You’re probably pushing back on this idea right now. Everyone wants to believe that if they say and do the right things, every seller will hire them, but it’s simply not true.


Still skeptical? Keep reading. In this chapter, you’ll see how one faulty assumption—that the playing field is level—wreaks havoc on your business every single day. More importantly, you’ll learn how focusing on high-probability opportunities can transform your life, and how to start doing that today.


## The Old Way: Chase, Convince, Close


Ask yourself if any of this sounds familiar:


You get excited about every phone call from a new prospect.


On those calls, your primary objective is to get a listing appointment.


You think that the more listing appointments you go on, the more listings you’ll get.


You believe prospects are making decisions based on the quality of your listing presentations, so you put a lot of time, effort, energy, and resources into them.


You know not every appointment will result in a listing, but you consider that a cost of doing business.


You chase every opportunity that crosses your path because if you don’t, you might not get anything at all.


The vast majority of real estate agents think this way, so I don’t blame you for doing the same. Unfortunately, it’s all wrong.


Chris and I coach agents who now go on zero listing appointments and do more business than ever. It’s not because they’re superstars who are so in demand that they can afford not to do the work that “regular” people have to do. It’s because they’ve accepted and adapted to a reality of the human condition: there’s no such thing as a fully open mind 7.


The truth is, most people who contact you have no intention of ever hiring you.


They’re not being deceptive or manipulative on purpose. They think their minds are open. But as soon as they start gathering information to make a decision, they begin to lean towards certain choices, and away from others. They start to pick a Favorite, maybe even unconsciously. Most top agents believe they are going to walk away from every listing appointment with a signed listing. Most newer agents are just happy to get a phone call. The idea that the seller has already made a decision (or is close to it) never crosses their mind.


When you’re the Favorite, chances are very high (probably 80 percent or better) that you’ll get the listing. It’s not because of your killer presentation, though. The prospect picked you before you ever walked into that house, whether they realized it or not.


When you’re not the Favorite, you’re the Fool—and there is always a fool in the game. The prospect is interviewing multiple agents because it’s the responsible thing to do, but it’s just due diligence. They might even use the ideas and information you provide, but the chances of swaying them away from their Favorite are low (maybe 20 percent at best), even if you say and do all the right things.


Twenty percent isn’t zero, though, and there’s the danger. Sometimes, you’ll win one of these low-probability listings, and that makes you believe that you can convince people to choose you. You start to think that if you can just make your presentation a little better—more polished, more exciting, more insightful, more packed with reasons why you’re the best—you’ll persuade more people to hire you. But convincing is hard work, and it doesn’t feel good for you or them.


Would you rather go on a date with someone who is thrilled to be with you, or someone you had to beg? Which situation would make you feel more confident and relaxed? Which would be more enjoyable and more likely to end well?


Now, put yourself in their shoes. Would you rather go on a date with your crush, or someone who wore you down until you couldn’t say no? Which date are you more likely to walk into with a positive outlook? Which person are you more likely to forgive for a little mistake or imperfection?


If you have to convince someone to work with you, chances are high that they’ll have a bad attitude, unreasonable expectations, and little mercy. Your relationship with them is weak from the get-go. After the hard work of convincing them to hire you, you’ll have an even harder time convincing them to trust and respect you. When you hit the bumps that are inevitable in every real estate transaction, you’ll be the one feeling the pain.


Marketing guru Joe Polish calls those clients HALFs®: hard, annoying, lame, and frustrating. (The L could stand for lucrative, which these clients sometimes are, but that money is hard earned indeed.)

When you’re the Fool, life is rough.


## The New Way: High-Probability Activity


Fortunately, the solution is simple: find out whether you’re the Favorite or the Fool as fast as possible, and if you’re not the Favorite, walk away. You’re probably thinking that sounds incredibly scary, but bear with me.


There are two kinds of phone calls you’ll get in your business. One is, “We’re gonna sell, and we want you to list our home.” The other is, “We’re interviewing agents.”


Build your business around the first call.


This is about stacking the odds in your favor. As Chris says, we live in a Las Vegas world, and not all the games give you the same chance of success. That first call is a table where your odds of winning are 80 percent. At the other table, your odds are just 20 percent. Which table do you want to sit at?


The answer seems obvious, but in reality, you’ve probably spent most of your career at that low-probability table: chasing and convincing, chasing and convincing, over and over, hoping and praying that someone will eventually pick you. You’ve seen how well that works. This book is about choosing to focus on high-probability activity instead. From now on, you’re going to sit at the 80 percent table.


When you embrace the concept of the Favorite or the Fool, everything gets simplified. You no longer have to walk around on eggshells, worrying whether someone will work with you or not, fearful of saying or doing the wrong thing. When you’re the Favorite, clients will commit to you up front, so there’s no wondering or guessing. It’s a magical thing.


When you do meet the prospective seller in their living room, it’s not a listing appointment where you’re trying to win them over with your valuable insights, which they may or may not swipe and use some other agent. Instead, it’s a strategy meeting with paying clients who are already receptive to your advice. Building trust is natural, the work is more enjoyable, and the bumps in the road are easier to handle.


As Joe Polish puts it, those clients are ELFs®: easy, lucrative, and fun.


Best of all, those clients are far more likely to hire you repeatedly and refer people to you. That’s the key to building the strong, reliable, profitable business you’re dreaming of. We all know that repeat and referral business is the true gold mine of real estate, and now you know why: because you’re already the Favorite. The more often you’re the Favorite, the more often you will be the Favorite in the future. It’s a virtuous cycle with the power to transform your entire career and life. Repeat and referral business is the low hanging fruit in real estate. Stop making the rookie mistake of not nurturing relationships on a daily basis.


Now, here’s the part you’re not going to like. You’re going to resist this with every fiber of your being because it goes against what you’ve always believed about how to succeed in business.


To make room for high-probability activity, you have to say NO to everything else. (Gently, of course—we’ll get to that later in this chapter.)


That’s right—I’m telling you to let all those other opportunities pass you by. Turn them down, even though you may have a 20 percent chance of converting. Let them go. Save yourself the time, money, and heartache. They weren’t going to go well for you anyway.


The FOMO is going to kick in hard here, but you’ve got to fight past it. That fear is lying to you. It’s saying there aren’t enough opportunities where you’re the Favorite, and if you start passing things up, you won’t do enough deals. Your business will fail. You’ll lose everything. You’ll starve. You’ll die.


This is the place where your mind actually goes. Be ready for it. If you don’t believe me, pay close attention to your self-talk next time you’re in a competitive situation. You’ll be shocked at the nonsense that takes place in your head.


But no, you’re not going to die.


It’s just your limbic brain—home of the survival instinct—blowing things out of proportion. The idea of giving up opportunities feels like a threat, so your brain revs up your anxiety, preparing you to fight, fly, or freeze. This isn’t a saber-toothed tiger lurking in the bushes, ready to kill you, but your brain can’t tell the difference.


As hard as it is to believe, even if you are the Favorite with only one or two out of ten people, there is still an abundance of business to do. There is never a lack of opportunity, only a lack of awareness, focus, and effort. When you make being the Favorite your standard for doing business, this choice will compound to your advantage in ways you never dreamed possible.


We’ve seen this play out time after time among the agents we coach. Choosing high-probability activity over low-probability activity is one of the first changes they have to make, and for most, it’s an extremely challenging transition. It feels like you’re going to lose business, and you might remember from Chapter 1 that human beings fear loss twice as much as they desire equivalent gains.


The truth is, the only things my agents have lost are dead-end prospects and bad clients. What they gain is more time, more peace of mind, easier work, happier clients, and more repeat and referral business.


See? There’s truly nothing to fear about refusing to play the Fool. Here’s what you should really be afraid of: if you waste your time playing the Fool for everyone, you might miss the chance to be someone’s Favorite.


## Which One Are You?


It only takes one conversation to know if you’re the Favorite or the Fool. Chris and I call this process getting proof of life, which is what hostage negotiators do first to make sure the other party isn’t yanking their chain. But instead of finding out if the hostage is really there and still breathing, you want to know if there’s truly a deal here, and if so, whether it’s going to be with you.


It’s a cold read, just like what I used to do on the football field. Before each game, we would study the scouting report on our opponents. We had to learn everything backwards and forwards: all their stats and tendencies based on the down, distance, formation, field position, and a number of other factors. Knowing what the other team was likely to do in any given situation helped stack the odds in our favor come gametime. Our ability to anticipate just by reading the situation in front of us could be the difference between making the play and not making the play.


#### Tool: The Cold Read


Paying close attention to the other person’s words, tone, and body language to recognize patterns and predict their future behavior.


It’s no different when you’re in front of a potential seller or buyer. The clues as to whether you are the Favorite or the Fool are right there. The question is, do you recognize them? Do you know what sellers say and do when you’re the Favorite? What about when you’re the Fool? Being able to read the situation correctly is the difference between spending your time wisely or foolishly.


Some call this intuition, but it’s really just pattern recognition, and humans are hardwired to excel at it. You have this ability already—you just need to hone it. Prospects act one way when you’re the Favorite, another when you’re the Fool. The more you practice reading these patterns, the easier it will be to tell the difference.


The following five questions will give you a solid framework to figure out whether you’re the Favorite or Fool with each prospect. To be clear, these are questions you’re asking yourself, not the prospect. Don’t ask them these questions directly—we’ll explain exactly what to say to get to the answers, using the Black Swan Method.8 You’ll see how prospects reveal the answers in the way they talk with you. The more confirmations you get, the more likely you’re the Favorite.


### 1. Are they calling me specifically (or just agents)?


When talking to a prospect, the temptation is to jump straight into the sell. You want to tell them why they should work with you, why you could do the best job helping them sell or buy a home.


Don’t. Instead, ask them to tell you why they want to work with you.


This is the first application of a principle that will come back later in the book: it matters who says it. When you explain why you’re the right person for the job, you’re convincing. When you let them explain it, you’re putting their needs first and respecting their autonomy (which, as you learned in Chapter 1, people will die over).


So, ask the question: “I’m curious—of all the agents you know, why me?”


Tone of voice and pacing is critical. Go slow and be genuinely curious. Practice this line over and over again. Record yourself.


Now, listen to their answer…without hope in your heart. Don’t think about what you’re hoping to hear—just listen to what you’re actually hearing. Are the reasons specific? Do they know who you are, or did they just call on a whim after seeing your number on a lawn sign or in a Google search result?


Their answer to this question tells you exactly how they view your value proposition. The more they know about you and can articulate their reasons for calling you specifically (not just any agent), the more likely you’re the Favorite. A real answer is something you can label, mirror, and paraphrase.


Vague answers are a clue that you’re the Fool in the game. They might even turn the question around on you and say, “You tell me why I should hire you.” That’s a big, waving red flag.


The “Why me?” question is so powerful that we have yet to see it fail to reveal whether an agent is the Favorite or the Fool. This is the prospect’s chance to defend why they want to hire you. If you’re the Favorite, they’ll tell you. If you’re not, they’ll evade the question.


### 2. Do I fit the profile?


Here comes another throwback to Chapter 1: the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior. If they’ve ever bought or sold a home before, how did they pick their agent then? Was it based on a referral? Testimonials? Company affiliation? Some other factor?


Finding out how people have made big decisions in the past will help you understand how they are likely to choose an agent. There is probably a profile of the type of person that works best for them, and you want to evaluate whether you’re a good match. For example, if they found their last agent through a personal connection, and you’re a total stranger, the chances that they’ll go with you are slim. The better you fit the profile, the more likely you’re the Favorite.


Hint: If they have worked with another real estate agent in the past, be sure to find out whether they plan on working with that agent again. Instead of simply asking if they will, ask why they wouldn’t: “Why would you not use the agent you worked with before?”


Here are some other questions you can ask to help clarify the profile:


What do you want in an agent?


How have you made decisions like this in the past?


How will you know when you’ve met the right person?


What guidance are you getting on this decision?


How do you see this process unfolding?


Again, listen carefully to their answers without fear and hope. Do you fit the profile of the agent they’re looking for?


### 3. Can I make an emotional connection?


Now, can you get inside their head and read their mind? What you’re looking for here is a “that’s right” response.


Not “you’re right,” but “that’s right.”


We call that a two-millimeter shift: the difference seems small on the surface, but the consequences are massive. “You’re right” is what someone says when they’re caving to persuasion, or giving you a polite no or a false yes. “That’s right” is what they say when they feel understood, which is the ultimate goal of everything in this book.


#### Two-millimeter Shift: “You’re right” → “That’s right”


“You’re right” means they feel defensive and resistant. “That’s right” means they feel understood.


To get to “that’s right,” you’ll use two essential tools from the Tactical Empathy toolbox: labeling and mirroring.


Labeling is stating what the other person is thinking, feeling, or doing—putting a label on it. A label starts with one of these phrases:


It sounds like…


It seems like…


It feels like…


You’re probably thinking…


You’re probably feeling…


It ends with your best guess about what they’re actually thinking and feeling. You want to get inside the other person’s head and heart, to see the world from their perspective. That requires deep listening. You can’t be thinking about what you are going to say next. Your full attention needs to focus on the other person and where they’re coming from.


#### Tool: Labeling


Stating what the other person is thinking, feeling, or doing, using a phrase like “It seems like…” or “You’re probably thinking/feeling…”


To them, your labeling feels like mindreading, and that builds trust. When you can clearly articulate what someone is thinking and feeling, they’ll be much more open in their communications because they hear you “get it.” This concept will come back again in future chapters.


Here are a few examples of labeling with a potential client:


It sounds like you have a very specific price in mind…


It seems like selling in a timely fashion is very important to you…


It feels like this is going to be a very emotional process for you…


You’re probably thinking that your home will sell very quickly…


You’re probably feeling frustrated with the number of showings on your property so far…


The interesting thing about labeling is that it doesn’t matter if your label is right. If it is, you’ll probably get “that’s right” from the other person.


If it’s not, they won’t be annoyed. They’ll just give you more information to correct your misinterpretation. In fact, intentional mislabeling can be a very effective way to get someone to reveal more. People love to correct you when your label is wrong—for them, fixing it feels good.


Mirroring goes hand in hand with labeling. To do it, just repeat the last few words the other person just said.


Seller: We want to sell our home quickly.


Mirror: Quickly?


Seller: Yes, we want to be sold and closed by the end of summer.


Mirror: End of summer?


Mirroring gives you more clarity on what someone is saying. It takes the place of just guessing, or saying something like “Tell me more,” or “Can you be more specific?” It’s a powerful tool for getting people to express their thoughts and feelings more fully.


#### Tool: Mirroring


Repeating the last few words the other person just said, which often prompts them to expand on that train of thought.


Warning: Mirroring can feel very awkward at first. You’ll probably feel like you’re mimicking. Push past the discomfort and you’ll quickly see the value of this tool. The more people open up and share, the more trust you create.


With both labels and mirrors, there’s another two-millimeter shift going on: “I” to “you.”


Most agents are constantly in “I” mode, making every conversation about what they think and feel. See for yourself—record and listen back to your client calls. Check your emails. It’s “I,” “I,” “I” all over the place…but your interactions with clients and prospects are not about you. When you use “I,” the other party is tuning you out.


Labels and mirrors shift you into “you” mode. They force you to concentrate on what the other person is thinking and feeling. To use these tools successfully, with the right tone and pacing, you have to come from a place of curiosity about the other person, not your own hope and fear. Suddenly, you’re no longer talking about yourself and trying to steer the conversation in the direction you want. Instead, you’re listening to them and talking about their concerns, needs, and desires.


#### Two-millimeter Shift: “I” → “You”


When you’re using “I,” you’re focused on yourself. Use labels and mirrors to shift your attention back to the other person.


People can’t hear you until they feel heard. They won’t understand you until they feel understood. That’s Tactical Empathy 101, the fundamental stuff that no one has taught you before. When you actually start doing it, it’s money in the bank.


If you can use these tools to make the other person feel understood, you’ve created an emotional connection, and that’s a very good sign that you might be the Favorite.


### 4. Is the conversation collaborative?


Another good sign is when the conversation is two-way—both you and the prospect are giving and receiving information. The opposite of this is the classic “picking your brain” scenario, when they call to get information out of you and aren’t willing to give any in return.


The pricing conversation is the best example of this. If you say, “It sounds like you have a specific price in mind,” and they answer you directly, that’s a good sign that you’re the Favorite because they’re not afraid to share information with you.


If you’re the Fool, they’ll keep their cards close. They’ll say, “I don’t know. You’re the expert. That’s why we’re calling you.”


How annoying is that response? It’s total nonsense. You know it and they know it. Every seller has a price in mind. They might not know if it’s realistic, but it’s there.


In this case, the most effective label for getting them to open up is: “It sounds like you have a very specific number in mind.” If they still want to be evasive, try these:


You probably have looked on Zillow…


Zillow shows a price of $____________ …


You probably think that’s low…


You’re probably thinking closer to $____________ … (Here you give a much higher price, which will trigger the seller to say, “No, not that much.”)


The more you struggle to get straight answers about their target price and other important pieces of information, the more likely you’re the Fool. When you’re the Favorite, people will converse with you in an honest way, and not be evasive or stingy with their responses.


### 5. Are they opposed to making a commitment up front?


This is the toughest part of this whole process. It’s where the rubber meets the road. You’re going to think this will never work because everyone around you is doing the exact opposite. You’ll think that no client in their right mind will agree to this.


Don’t go see the property until the client has committed to working with you.


I know, every other agent is willing to go out and give a listing presentation with no commitment whatsoever. They spend hours researching the property and preparing for the appointment, then more hours driving out there and having that conversation. All on spec, with no assurance that they’ll ever get anything in return.


Some call that selling, but we call it free consulting, and it’s killing your business. The more value you give away for free, the less valuable you are. Let me repeat this, because you have built your entire real estate career on a false premise.


The more value you give away for free, the less valuable you are.


Why does someone need to work with you when you have given them your entire playbook at no charge? They have what they need, and will just go back to their Favorite to make sure they’re doing all the things you suggested. How often does a seller take your price, or your staging suggestions, or your marketing ideas, and list with another agent? Would I be wrong to think this has happened more than once or twice in your career?


Plus, the more time and energy you waste on listing appointments you’ll never win, the less you have for the people who actually want to work with you. So, no more free consulting (we’ll come back to this in Chapter 4).


If you’re the Favorite, getting a commitment won’t be an issue. The prospect knows they want to work with you, and will gladly commit before seeing your analysis of the property because they trust your expertise.


If you’re the Fool, you’ll see that refusing to be the victim—declining to give the prospect valuable information for free—sometimes provokes an aggressive response. They might try to pressure you by saying things like “It sounds like you don’t want my business.” These attacks just reveal that person as a predator. Predators attack people who refuse to be victimized. If you think back to prospects who have given you a hard time, you’ll recognize this behavior.


Don’t take it personally, get upset, or let them sway you. Instead, exit the situation gracefully: “It sounds like you already have a few good agents to choose from. Why don’t you meet with them, and if none of them work out, you can always reach out to me again.”


## It’s Okay to Walk Away


Everyone else is out there obsessing over their listing presentation, but the truth is, the whole thing is a farce. Sellers act like their minds are open, and they probably even believe it, but you know better now. They already had a Favorite before they even called you, and no listing presentation will change that.


I say it like it’s obvious, but I know it’s not. I spent the first twenty-five years of my coaching career teaching listing presentations. But when I found out (thanks to Chris) that it was all a waste of time, I changed my strategy in a heartbeat. In the five years since then, one truth has proven itself a million times over.


It’s not a sin to lose business—it’s a sin to take a long time to lose business.


Having a prospect get upset and walk away because you won’t do a listing appointment is fine. Investing eight hours or more into a listing appointment and not getting hired is not fine. Convincing a client to hire you, and later walking away or getting fired because you couldn’t meet their unreasonable demands is not fine.


That’s why it’s so important to answer all five of these questions in the very first conversation with each prospect. When you’re just starting to practice this, it might take thirty minutes or even an hour to suss out whether you’re the Favorite or the Fool. Over time, you’ll get more and more efficient, until you can do it in under fifteen minutes.


Imagine that. Instead of wasting a whole day or more on each prospect and still having no idea what they’ll do, you can spend just fifteen minutes finding out whether you have a serious shot or not.


That’s life changing.

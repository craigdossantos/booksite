### Key Takeaways



- Agents habitually take responsibility for problems and decisions that aren’t theirs, which causes huge amounts of unnecessary stress and work.
- You don’t own any of the decisions in this process. Only your client can make them, and when you try to do that for them, it violates their autonomy.
- You can only advise and guide them. Your only job is to provide the information they need to make a decision with confidence.
- When they decide for themselves—even if you guide them—they will be more committed to their choice and collaborative in implementing it with your help.
- It’s not helpful for you to get upset about problems on their behalf. You can understand their feelings without sharing them, and you’re better equipped to guide them from a place of calm than a place of stress.

### Key Takeaways



- When you avoid tough conversations and sugarcoat bad news, you undermine your clients’ trust in you, and their ability to make informed decisions.
- Everyone likes a straight shooter—someone who tells the truth gently.
- Don’t beat around the bush or try to solve the problem for them. Just brace them for the bad news, and use an Accusations Audit to defuse their negative emotions.
- Once you’ve delivered the news, be quiet. Silence gives the other person the space they need to process what you’ve said and consider their options.

## Tactical Empathy Toolbox



- Bracing for Bad News: Before you deliver potentially negative information, prepare the other person by saying “I have some bad news.”
- Accusations Audit: To defuse potential negative emotions, articulate all the awful things the other person might think or feel in response to your message.
- Late Night FM DJ Voice: A low, slow, soothing tone of voice that’s highly effective at getting other people to relax and slow down.
- Silence: After you deliver your information, stop talking. Give the other person ample space to process what you’ve said and express themselves. Let them break the silence. It’s not awkward—it’s essential.

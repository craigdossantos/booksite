##### Chapter 4.  Get the Elephants Out Early


The reasons someone might not want to do business with you are more important than the reasons they do.


After nurturing a potential client for over five years, Tracey* finally got the listing. The owner, Dave* 9, was ready and motivated to sell, and Tracey would have been elated, but there was just one problem: Dave’s expectations were unrealistic.


He wanted to list at $1.5 million without doing any staging, and he was convinced that his market research justified that price. Tracey knew better, and she gently suggested that the price might be a little high, and that staging was probably a good idea, but Dave wasn’t interested. She figured she could either take the listing on his terms or lose it, and she wasn’t about to give up on a prospect she had put so much effort into already.


So, they did what he wanted and waited to see who would bite…and waited, and waited some more. Weeks went by with no offers. No one even wanted to come see the house. It was clear that Dave’s plan had been a bad idea.


Now, Tracey is in a tough spot. She can try to convince Dave to lower the price by $100K and invest $10K in staging, and if she succeeds, the house will probably sell quickly. That won’t feel like a win to Dave, though. He’ll think he lost $110K, and because a loss stings twice as much as an equivalent gain, he’ll feel like he lost $220K. That’s not the kind of emotion that leads to referrals.


If she fails to convince him, or if she doesn’t try, the listing will expire. Another agent will come in, relist at a lower price, and get the commission, while Tracey walks away with nothing to show for all her effort.


She’s between a rock and a hard place, and it’s all because she didn’t get the elephants out early.


She’s not alone—the vast majority of agents do exactly what she did, and you probably do too. My coaching calls are full of problems just like this one: tough conversations that agents dread to have with their clients.


Pricing is a common sticking point, but it’s far from the only one. Tough conversations happen throughout the process, from getting hired all the way to closing the deal. Anytime your client’s desires and expectations don’t match up with reality, you’ve got a tough conversation on your hands.


Depending on how you approach them, these conversations can build one of two things: trust or resentment. Unfortunately, our instincts tend to lead us down the second path instead of the first.


In this chapter, you’ll learn why the usual way of addressing problems is so counterproductive, and how to do it in a way that strengthens your relationship with your clients instead of undermining it. Instead of treating tough conversations as threats, you’ll see them as opportunities.


## The Old Way: Avoid and Sugarcoat


No one likes to be the bearer of bad news. Bad news upsets people, and you don’t want your clients to be upset—you want them to be happy. You want them to have confidence in you. You want them to like you.


Telling them something they don’t want to hear doesn’t seem like the best way to achieve that, does it? If you reveal the ugly truth, you might lose the client or the deal.


So, you try not to mention anything that might drive them away. When you’re wooing them to hire you, you focus on why they should work with you, and avoid any hint of why they might not want to. That includes your commission—ideally, it never comes up until they see the contract, and then they just sign without questioning it, and you breathe a big sigh of relief.


When you’re getting ready to list (or search for properties, if your client is a buyer), you prefer not to crush their dreams, even if you know their expectations are totally out of whack. They’ll figure it out for themselves when they see that their house doesn’t sell, or their budget won’t get them everything they’re hoping for. That way, reality is the one that disappoints them, not you.


Some ugly truths can’t be avoided, though. When the inspection reveals problems, when the counteroffer gets rejected, when the other side is asking for concessions…you have to say something.


If you are like most agents, you dread these conversations. They’re the ones that keep you up at night, imagining how your clients will explode at you, or maybe even fire you. It’s the absolute worst part of your job, so you often find yourself delaying and searching for ways out of the situation. Standard practice is to take the problem, stick it in a drawer, and hope it goes away magically.


How much time have you spent spinning things in your head in an effort to preserve what you hope is the client’s favorable opinion of you?


At some point in the transaction, though, you have to face the music. When that time comes, you play down the negatives and look for a silver lining or some kind of solution to the problem, hoping that might mitigate their anger and disappointment. As the saying goes, “Bring me solutions, not problems.” If you do that, they can’t fault you, right?


Whether you’re avoiding or sugarcoating, minimizing your client’s negative emotions is the name of the game.


I get it. If you’re anything like most agents, you’re a people person…dare I say, a people pleaser. You hate to upset anyone, and you hate even more for anyone to be upset at you. You know unhappy clients won’t refer to you in the future, and they make you miserable in the present, so you do everything in your power to squash negativity.


Unfortunately, while avoiding and sugarcoating may seem to keep negative emotions at bay, what those tactics really do is generate stress and undermine your clients’ trust in you. People may not like hearing bad news, but what they like even less is getting blindsided by it, and that’s exactly what happens when you try to tiptoe around the tough stuff. When they finally see the problem, they think, Why am I hearing this now when you could have told me ages ago?


There are only two answers to that, and neither one makes you look good. The first is you didn’t anticipate this problem, in which case your competence comes into question. The second is you did anticipate it, but didn’t say anything, which makes them wonder what else you’re holding back, and whose interests you’re prioritizing—theirs or your own. The cover up is always worse than the crime.


Instead of protecting your relationship with your clients, avoiding and sugarcoating bad news has inadvertently wrecked it.


## The New Way: Be a Straight Shooter


Bad news is a bummer, but you know what everyone likes? A straight shooter: someone who tells it like it is, and doesn’t keep you guessing or try to pull the wool over your eyes.


Instead of shying away from problems, a straight shooter confronts them head-on as soon as they become apparent, just like the buffalo in the storm. While this may seem scary, it always leads to better outcomes for both you and your client. If the problem is a dealbreaker for them, it’s better to get it on the table now than to waste more of anyone’s time on a deal that will never close. If it’s not, they’ll thank you for bringing it up as soon as possible.


Don’t mistake this transparency for brutal honesty. We’re in the business of making people feel understood, and brutality has no place there. There’s no reason honesty has to feel like a brick to the face, and it never should if you’re delivering it right.


That’s what the rest of this chapter is about: how to deliver bad news and confront negative emotions in a way that makes people feel understood. You’ll learn exactly what to say, how to say it, and why these nuances of language are such powerful tools for building trust with your clients.


## Call Out the Negatives


If you’ve been in an airport or on public transit recently, you’ve probably seen signs that say, “If you see something, say something.” That’s a Department of Homeland Security slogan urging you to report suspicious activity to law enforcement, but you might as well print that out and slap it on your office wall, because it applies to real estate too.


In fact, it applies to every kind of tough conversation, from family spats to hostage negotiations. It’s one of the key negotiation tactics that Chris learned in his time with the FBI, and continues to use with all his negotiation coaching clients. Only instead of reporting suspicious activity, you’re calling out negative emotions.


Whenever you sense that your client is unhappy, say so. It doesn’t matter whether you know the reason why. It doesn’t even matter if your interpretation of their mood is correct. If you see something, say something: “You seem upset/frustrated/disappointed,” or whatever emotion fits best.


You probably think this sounds crazy. Why would you call attention to a negative emotion—isn’t that just inviting it out to play? And what if you’re just imagining it—wouldn’t that just create a problem where there wasn’t one?


Here’s the truth: it’s impossible to speak a problem into existence. If you’re mistaken, they’ll correct you, no harm done. If you’re not, and there really are negative emotions happening, naming them actually reduces them.


That’s science. Studies have shown that when people label their negative emotions, their physiological experience of those emotions diminishes.10 All those stress symptoms that pop up when you’re upset—elevated heart rate, shallow breathing, high blood pressure, sweating, nausea, muscle tension, etc.—actually get better when you put a label on what you’re feeling. (Remember labels from Chapter 2? Yep, here they come again.)


Why does this work? It all comes back to Tactical Empathy, a.k.a. making people feel understood.


When someone tells you not to feel something (Don’t be upset!), does that make you feel understood? Of course not. It does the opposite—it convinces you that they don’t understand your perspective at all. Denying negative emotions has a 100 percent failure rate.


What about when they ignore what you’re feeling? No, you don’t feel understood then either. Once in a while, unspoken negative emotions just fade away, but most of the time, they fester like an untreated wound. Not pleasant.


You’re probably starting to see why labeling negative emotions is the way to go. By calling them out instead of waiting for the other person to bring it up, you show that you’re paying attention to how they feel. When they feel understood, their brains release oxytocin, which mitigates the stress response. Your label doesn’t fan the flames of negativity—it douses them.


This works even if the label is completely wrong. If you say, “You seem upset,” when they’re not, they won’t hesitate to say, “No, I’m just thinking through my options,” or whatever else is going on in their heads. As we mentioned in Chapter 2, a mislabel often leads the other person to reveal even more information than a correct label does. And it still makes them feel understood, because you’ve shown your consideration for their feelings, and given them an opportunity to communicate their thinking.


## Get in Front of Things


The fear of speaking problems to life also keeps agents from preparing their clients for what lies ahead. Before you ever talk to a prospective client, you already know about all the objections they might have to working with you, not to mention all the obstacles they might face once the work begins. But if you’re like most agents, you don’t say anything. You just cross your fingers, and hope those issues won’t come up.


That automatically puts you behind the ball. It sets you up for that ugly question: Why didn’t you tell me sooner? Don’t put yourself in that position. Instead, bring up those objections and obstacles before they take you down.


Once again, this might seem crazy. Why on earth would you talk about reasons not to work with you when your goal is to convince them to hire you? Why would you freak them out now about problems that may or may not come up during the sales process?


Because it builds trust.


#### Two-millimeter Shift: Waiting → Getting in Front of Things


When you delay the delivery of potentially negative information, you undermine the other person’s trust in you. Instead, bring it up as soon as you can. If it’s a dealbreaker, you waste less time, and if not, your transparency builds trust.


Not long ago, Chris was shopping for a new car. At the dealership, he asked the salesman if the chassis of the car he was looking at was good. “Of course!” the salesman said. “It’s the best on the market!”


Would you have believed that guy? Yeah, neither did Chris.


Now, imagine the salesman had said something like, “Well, it’s the best on the market for off-roading, but it’s not the most comfortable for city driving and long road trips.”


Suddenly, he seems like a trustworthy source of guidance for your car purchase. And look at how he did it—by anticipating a possible objection. Instead of pretending his product was perfect, he acknowledged up front that it wasn’t ideal for everyone.


Could that cost him a sale? You might think so, but think again.


Would anyone who objected to a stiff ride have ever bought that car anyway? No, but they might have wasted another hour of the salesman’s time before figuring out the car didn’t meet their needs. Or worse, they might have bought the car and then brought it back a week later, having realized their mistake. Either way, the salesman would have been better off if the customer had walked away in the beginning.


That’s why the reasons someone might not want to do business with you are more important than the reasons they do. You are not a trustworthy authority on your own value…unless you also acknowledge the client’s potential objections. Then, instead of convincing the client to hire you, you’re simply informing them and allowing them to choose for themselves. As we mentioned in Chapter 1, people will die over their autonomy. When you let them keep it, their trust in you grows.


#### Two-millimeter Shift: Why → Why Not


The reasons someone might not want to do business with you are more important than the reasons they do.


Warning people about potential obstacles achieves the same thing.


Just imagine your friend invites you to go for a walk in the park. Only when you arrive do you realize that it’s a National Park, and the trail is several miles of hilly terrain. You’re totally unprepared, and by the end, you’re exhausted, dirty, sunburnt, bug-eaten, and dehydrated. Oh yeah, and angry at your friend.


Now, imagine that instead, she invites you on a long, challenging hike and advises you to wear sturdy shoes and bring water, sunscreen, bug spray, and a raincoat, just in case. It’s the same trail as before, but in this scenario, you’re ready for it. It’s still a tough hike, but at the end, you’re grateful for the advice she gave you, and happy you didn’t even need to use the raincoat.


Preparing your clients for the possible challenges ahead won’t scare them off—if it does, they weren’t ready for this road anyway, and working with them was never going to end well. For the clients that are ready, discussing potential issues before they arise can only build their confidence in you. It shows you know what you’re doing and want them to have the best possible experience. If any of those problems come to pass, they’ll be thankful for the advance warning, and if nothing bad happens, they’ll be even happier that you were able to smooth the road for them.


## Brace Them for Bad News


In this business, there’s no escaping bad news. No matter how well you do your job, problems happen. Sometimes they’re outside your control, and sometimes they’re not. Sometimes you anticipated them and warned your client, and sometimes you didn’t. Regardless, you have to deliver the message.


The good news is that people want you to tell them the truth…gently. Don’t just blurt it out, but don’t dance around it either. Instead, ease them into it with two powerful techniques: bracing and the Accusations Audit.


Bracing is deceptively simple: “I have some bad news.”


Those five words give you the ability to have any tough conversation. They instantly make it easier for both you and your client to broach any uncomfortable subject.


#### Tool: Bracing for Bad News


Before you deliver potentially negative information, prepare the other person by saying, “I have some bad news.”


This is one of the most important and valuable phrases you will learn in this book. “I have some bad news…” is such an incredibly versatile turn of words, and can be used in so many different situations. Once you get comfortable with this language, you will never fear another difficult conversation. It gives you a way in whenever there is something challenging that needs to be discussed.


These words inspire dread, which is, unbelievably, the point. When you say them to a client or prospect or agent, the first place their mind goes is death—literally.


Bad news? What could it possibly be? In a fraction of a second, they’re already picturing the most horrifying thing they can think of.


That’s the beauty of it: the actual bad news is almost never as bad as they imagined. Instead of going from neutral to upset, they’re going from terrified to upset, which actually feels like a relief. The facts of the situation are no different, but they feel less terrible than they would have if you hadn’t braced them.


#### Two-millimeter Shift: Sugarcoating → Bracing


When you try to put a positive spin on bad news, it comes across as disingenuous and manipulative. Bracing them for it softens the blow.


There’s a second reason this works so well. The regions of the brain that react to emotional pain are the same as those for physical pain, and studies of physical pain show that bracing for it can actually reduce the perceived intensity of the pain. If you say, “This is gonna hurt,” the person prepares mentally, and if the blow strikes within a short window after that, it hurts less than if it had struck without warning. You can’t wait too long, though, or the anticipation itself becomes painful.


So warn them, wait for them to give you permission to proceed, then let it fly. This concept is one of the easiest things to implement in this whole book, and it instantly transforms your approach to tough conversations.


## Do an Accusations Audit®


You can take this even further—and we strongly recommend that you do—with an Accusations Audit. When you anticipate that a client (or anyone else) will have a very negative reaction to your news, this is an essential tool for reducing the fallout.


The essence of it is this: before you deliver the bad news, you tell your client all the horrible things they’ll think and feel when they hear it. You lay out all the possible accusations they might make, no holds barred (which is why it’s called an Accusations Audit). You keep going with the accusations until the client pushes back, and only then do you deliver the news.


#### Tool: Accusations Audit


To defuse potential negative emotions, articulate all the awful things the other person might think or feel in response to your message.


The easiest way to understand this is to see it in action. So, let’s go back to the story of Tracey and Dave from the beginning of the chapter. Tracey has to tell Dave that the house won’t sell unless he lowers the price and invests in staging. If she’s savvy enough to use bracing and the Accusations Audit, here’s how that conversation would go.


Tracey: “Dave, I have some bad news.”


That’s bracing. She’s asking permission to deliver the truth.


Dave: “Uh oh. What’s going on?”


She just got the go-ahead signal.


Tracey: “You’re not going to want to hear this. You’re going to be furious. You’ll think I have no idea what I’m doing. You might even want to fire me.”


With these accusations, Dave starts to wonder what could possibly be so bad.


Dave: “What do you mean?”


Tracey: “You’re going to wonder why I didn’t say this before. You’ll probably question my intentions, and think I deceived you in some way.”


The more extreme the accusation, the more Dave wants to distance himself from it. He wants to think of himself as a reasonable person, not someone who would think or say those things.


Dave: “I wouldn’t think that, Tracey.”


He pushes back on the accusations, giving Tracey the signal that it’s safe to deliver her message.


Tracey: “The reality is, this house won’t sell unless we get it professionally staged and lower the price by $100K.”


She delivers the news clearly, without sugarcoating, apologizing, taking responsibility for the situation, or trying to solve it. She simply states the facts, then waits in complete and total silence.


Dave: “Wow. Okay. I appreciate your honesty. That’s a tough pill to swallow, but I guess we have to do what we have to do. Let me think about it overnight, and I will get back to you in the morning.”


The next day, Dave might come back and say, “My wife and I talked this over. We’ve got to be realistic about this if we want it to sell. Let’s do it. Lower the price and let’s set up the staging.”


What just happened? Why wasn’t Dave upset after Tracey told him exactly what he didn’t want to hear?


It’s the same thing that happens with “I have some bad news,” only more powerful. If you overblow the prospect of negativity, when you finally deliver the news, it feels like a relief. By verbalizing your client’s worst possible reactions ahead of time, you actually inoculate against them. You take away their gunpowder.


It’s simple, but counterintuitive. Put yourself in Dave’s shoes. You like to think of yourself as a reasonable person, not someone who would explode with rage. You chose Tracey to help you, and don’t want to think you put your trust in the wrong person. So, when she says, “You’re going to want to fire me” and “You’re going to think I deceived you,” your instinct is to distance yourself from that. By saying those things, she made you want to avoid making them true.


#### Two-millimeter Shift: Solving Problems → Defusing Negative Emotions


When problems come up, your instinct is to solve them, but that’s not what your clients need. Instead, use an accusations audit to defuse their negative emotions so they can make an informed decision about how to proceed.


Notice that Tracey kept going with the accusations until Dave pushed back on them. That was the signal that he didn’t want to think and feel those things, and had braced himself against them. At that point, he had decided to receive the news calmly, no matter how bad it was. That’s when Tracey knew it was safe to proceed.


This pushback can manifest in different ways. Here are some of the things clients might say that signal they’re ready to hear your message:



- I wouldn’t think/say/do/feel that.
- You’re being too hard on yourself.
- It can’t be that bad.
- Just tell me already.
- Rip the bandaid off.

The more trust you’ve built with a client, the quicker this happens. When trust is weak, it can take a lot more accusations to get to this point. If their verbal or body language (including silence) in any way indicates they might agree with your accusations, you haven’t gone far enough yet.


That’s why it’s important to prepare thoroughly for the conversation. Before you go into this situation, sit down and write out all the negative things the client could possibly think or feel in response to what you’re going to tell them. Be specific. For example:



- You’re going to be crushed/furious/disgusted/etc.
- You’ll probably feel that I let you down.
- You’re going to think I should have seen this coming.
- You’ll probably wonder how this could happen when the market is so hot.
- You’re going to think I was out of touch with the market.
- You’ll probably think I’m only concerned about my own interests.
- You’ll probably want to fire me on the spot.
- You’ll think I’m the worst agent in the world.
- You’re going to hate me.

Remember, it’s impossible for a label to plant a negative thought that wasn’t already there, so get as extreme as possible. There’s no way to overdo it. The harsher the negative label is, the more likely your client will push back on it, which is exactly what you want.


As you prepare, you can also use the same strategy to reduce your own negative emotions. Just label all the negative things you’re thinking and feeling as you anticipate the conversation. For example:



- I’m feeling fearful.
- I’m afraid the client will yell at me.
- I’m looking for a way to sugarcoat this.
- I’m looking for a way out of this conversation.
- I’m scared.

Another thing you should do to prepare is practice your late night FM DJ voice. Slow down and speak in a low, soothing tone, as if you were the host of a late night radio show. This tone is highly effective at getting other people to relax and slow down because calm is contagious.


#### Tool: Late Night FM DJ Voice


A low, slow, soothing tone of voice that’s highly effective at getting other people to relax and slow down.


Look back at Tracey and Dave’s conversation. At any point, did she explain her thinking, defend herself, or debate with her client? No. She just laid out what she imagined Dave would be thinking and feeling, then delivered the truth. That’s all you need to do. You don’t need to solve the problem, or even explain how it happened. You just need to deliver the news gently, and that’s exactly what the Accusations Audit allows you to do. It minimizes the negativity that both you and your client experience.


Sometimes, you don’t get the chance to do an Accusations Audit before the bad news drops. Instead, your client finds out first, and then you have to deal with the aftermath. The Accusations Audit is still useful in that situation. All you have to do is adjust your phrasing: “You’ll probably __________________” becomes “You probably ___________________,” and “You’re going to ___________________” becomes “I know you ___________________.”


Here’s an insider tip from Chris: “I know” is the way to go when the other person is really upset. He started using “I know” instead of “You probably” when talking to the families of kidnapping victims. Imagine saying to the parents, “You’re probably worried about your daughter’s safety.” Probably? It’s insulting just to imply there might be a chance they’re not. But you’re not guessing—you know they’re worried. So, say so.


## Silence Is Your Friend


Once you’ve delivered the news, there’s one more thing you need to do: shut up.


Seriously. Just stop talking. Let there be silence. Don’t try to fill it—the other person needs it. They need mental space to process what you’ve just said and consider their options, and if you keep speaking, you’re stealing that from them.


Most people can’t stand silence in a conversation. They think it means something is wrong, so it makes them feel extremely uncomfortable. The reflex is to fill it with anything you can think of—small talk, platitudes, questions, anything to keep it from being awkward.


But what if silence actually means something good is happening? What if it’s an indicator that the other person is doing exactly what you need them to do: thinking about what you’ve just told them?


#### Tool: Silence


After you deliver your information, stop talking. Give the other person ample space to process what you’ve said and express themselves. Let them break the silence. It’s not awkward—it’s essential.


If you’re like most agents, when you deliver bad news, or lay out a tough choice for your clients, you usually jump straight into problem solving. Instead of stepping back and giving the client room to think, you try to do the thinking for them, and it’s not out of the goodness of your heart. It’s out of fear. Maybe if you can solve the problem, the client won’t get upset or blame you for it.


But your problem solving is just getting in their way. How well would you think with someone jabbering at you nonstop?


Silence isn’t just something you should learn to tolerate. It’s a tool you need to use proactively in every tough conversation you have. Do your Accusations Audit, deliver the bad news, and be quiet. The last step is just as important as the first two.


In the next chapter, you’ll see exactly why.

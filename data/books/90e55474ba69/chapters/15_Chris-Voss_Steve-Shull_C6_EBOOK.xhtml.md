##### Chapter 6.  Let Them Say No


People hate to say yes, but they love to say no.


You’ve probably heard of momentum selling. It’s that decades-old strategy where the salesperson asks a prospect a series of questions, all of which are designed to elicit a yes answer. Even if you’ve never heard the phrase “momentum selling,” you’ve definitely had it done to you by a telemarketer or sidewalk fundraiser.


For example, here’s a classic listing presentation technique taught by a leading real estate trainer:


Agent: Do you absolutely have to sell your home?


Prospect: Yes.


Agent: Do you want to get top dollar?


Prospect: Yes.


Agent: Do you want me to handle the sale?


Prospect: Yes.


Allegedly, it’s that simple.


From the salesperson’s perspective, momentum selling is an attractive idea. All you have to do is ask the right series of questions, and people will feel like they have to say yes to your offer. It makes sense on the surface: people don’t like to contradict themselves, especially not in an obvious, public way, right? So, if you get them to say yes to easy, noncommittal questions, they’ll be more likely to say yes to an offer that’s aligned with those answers.


The rule of thumb is that if a person says yes three times, you’ve succeeded—you’ll get a sale. Each yes is a tie down, and by the time you’ve got three, most people won’t be able to escape.


If you’re wondering whether that’s as sleazy and manipulative as it sounds, the answer is yes.


Buyers hate this tactic. Why do you think people hang up on telemarketers and avoid eye contact with sidewalk fundraisers? They know what’s coming, and they don’t want to get trapped. When they do get caught in a momentum selling ambush, they might say yes, but their actions probably won’t support their words.


So, why do so many salespeople (including real estate agents) still do it? Well, it seems to work. At least, it can bring your closing rate to something more like 5–10 percent. For someone whose closing rate was close to zero, that could be a tenfold increase! You can’t argue with that, can you?


Well, we’re gonna.


If you’ve been paying attention, you knew that already. This way of selling goes against everything you’ve learned so far. If you’re only pursuing opportunities where you’re the Favorite, your closing rate should be closer to 100 percent than 10, and you don’t need underhanded tactics to achieve that because those prospects chose you before you ever met them. And if you’re building a business on trust instead of value, undermining your clients’ autonomy by trapping them into saying yes is a surefire way to fail.


Salespeople are obsessed with yes. Even if they’re not using momentum selling in this stereotypically slimy way, they’re looking for other ways to get to that magic word. Every yes is a victory.


Not for clients, though. What feels like a win to you feels like vulnerability to them. When they say yes, it’s usually with caution, wariness, and skepticism. That emotional state is not at all conducive to building a trusting relationship where they enjoy working with you and are open to your influence. You want your clients to feel safe and in control, not vulnerable and guarded.


So instead of yes, you’re going to aim for no.


That probably sounds crazy. In business, yes means progress, and no means getting stalled. How can it possibly be productive to aim for no?


In this chapter, you’ll find out.


## The Old Way: Push for Yes


For a moment, think like a regular person, not a salesperson. When someone approaches you with an offer or request, what’s your first instinct? If you had to give a yes or no response within half a second, before you’ve had time to think about it, what would you say?


No. Every single time, no.


When you walk into a store and the salesperson immediately asks if they can help you find anything, you say no, even if you are looking for something specific.


When a stranger calls and asks if it’s a good time to talk, you say no, even if you’re not busy.


When your teenage kid asks to borrow the car, you say no, even if there’s no good reason.


No is safe. It’s the status quo. When you’re not sure if something will be good for you, you protect yourself by pushing it away. Even when you do end up saying yes after you consider the situation, your very first instinct was to say no.


That’s why salespeople try to use questions that couldn’t possibly have any answer other than yes. Do you want to make more money? Do you care about children? Could you spare a dime a day? If you say no, you feel like a liar, an idiot, or a jerk.


It can be more subtle too. Back in the day (before I met Chris), I wrote tons of sales scripts designed to lead people down a very reasonable, logical path to yes. Do you want to net the most money possible? Do you want a strong negotiator representing you? Do you want to make sure you’re not leaving any money on the table?


Like I said before, that stuff works. At least, it works better than not doing it…if you’re trying to sell your value to every person that walks in your door.


Those sales scripts do get people to agree, and salespeople celebrate every yes they get, but they shouldn’t. Those victories are hollow, and liable to disappear at any moment.


Think about it—when you get pressured into saying yes to a question that couldn’t possibly have any other answer, you’re suspicious. What does this person want from you, and how are you going to keep them from manipulating you? So you say yes, but it’s not real. You’re just leading them on to find out what else they’re going to say…and how you can get out of this conversation gracefully.


That’s what you’re doing to your clients when you use momentum selling. They’ll say yes to make you happy and get you off their back, but they probably don’t mean it. In the meantime, you’ve undermined their trust in you by threatening their autonomy. Next time you talk, they’ll approach the conversation with resistance ready to go in advance.


We don’t want rejection, so why do we keep doing things that invite it?


It’s like a slot machine. Most of the time, you strike out. But every once in a while, you win one, and it feels so good that you forget all the losses. So, you keep pulling, even though that thing is going to bankrupt you eventually.


It’s time to kick the yes habit.


## The New Way: Master No


People hate to say yes, but they love to say no. Once they’ve said no, they’re actually more open to listening to you because they’ve protected themselves and established their control over the situation. Their autonomy is intact, and you aren’t threatening it, so they actually have the mental space to process what you’re saying.


So, start by triggering a no on purpose. Instead of asking questions designed to lead to yes, ask questions where a no serves you, a.k.a. a no-oriented question. For example:



- Would you be opposed to me sharing a story?
- Would it be unreasonable to do a Zoom call before I visit the property?
- Would it be impossible to stage the property before we list it?
- Are you totally against the idea of us working together?
- Would it be wrong to assume you’ve formed an impression of whether you want to work with me?
- Would it be crazy to think you have a price in mind?
- Would it be out of line to ask if you’re considering other agents?
- Would it be off base to say you’re looking to sell quickly?

You can take the beginnings of those sentences and finish them with whatever you want—whatever would make a no work in your favor. You’re not restricted to that formula, though. Any yes-oriented question can be turned around into a no-oriented question or statement.


#### Tool: No-Oriented Question


A question designed to elicit a no response, where no moves the conversation forward instead of shutting it down.


For example, shop salespeople usually ask, “Can I help you find anything?” If they really want to help you (maybe they work on commission), they should say, “You probably know what you’re looking for and don’t need my help.”


Here’s a common one: when you call people, you probably ask, “Is now a good time to talk?” Instead, you should ask, “Is now a bad time to talk?”


They could say, “Yes, it’s a bad time, I’m very busy,” but they usually don’t. Why? Because people love to say no. It’s not a logical thing—it’s emotional. No matter which question you ask, the first thing they want to say is no. So, ask the question where no moves the conversation forward.


You’ll see this for yourself when you try it with your prospects. You know sellers expect agents to come give a listing presentation, and you also now know that this free consulting is killing your business. It’s not necessary, or a good use of your time, and you want to avoid doing it.


Here’s how you use a no-oriented question to achieve that: Would you be opposed to doing a video call before I come out to the house?


They almost always say no.


Turn it into a yes-oriented question (Could we do a video call before I come out to the house?), and you’ll get a very different response: resistance. Why do we need to do that? Why is this person asking something unexpected of me? They want to say no, and with this yes-oriented question, no is unhelpful.


No-oriented questions unlock all kinds of barriers. When people feel safe, they’ll listen more openly, offer information more freely, and collaborate more readily.


## Calibrated Questions™ 12


The key to all that information and collaboration is calibrated questions. These are open-ended questions that are calibrated to put the other person in an open frame of mind towards you. Usually, they’re how or what questions. For example:



- What would need to happen…?
- What would that look like?
- What criteria are most important to you?
- What should the next step be?
- How should we proceed?
- How will you decide?
- How would you see us working together?

With these questions, you’re showing deference to the other person, which warms them to you. People love to be asked what they think. It makes them feel respected, valued, and heard.


#### Tool: Calibrated Questions


Open-ended questions (almost always beginning with how or what) designed to put the other person in an open frame of mind towards you.


You’re also prompting them to think deeply. This stops people in their tracks, and forces them to carefully consider whatever situation or choice you’ve put in front of them. Instead of dwelling on their emotional reaction to it, they focus on solving the problem or clarifying their desires and intentions, within the safety of their own autonomy.


That’s why these questions are so effective at revealing important information and inviting collaboration with your clients. As you learned in Chapter 5: whatever you want them to do, they need to think it’s their idea.


Before you can break out the how and what questions, first make them feel understood. Use mirrors and labels to get them to say “that’s right” (flip back to Chapter 2 for a refresher on this). You’ll feel that emotional click when you get in alignment with them, and that’s when you can start guiding them to where they want to go.


How and what questions put the ball in the other person’s court and make them think. Their answers reveal what they will and won’t do, so you don’t have to guess. Here are some examples of calibrated questions that can work in many situations throughout the real estate sales process:



- What are you really hoping for?
- What is important to you about that?
- What would make this a great experience for you?
- What is most important to you during this process?
- What are your biggest concerns?
- What are you basing that on?
- What have I left out?
- What else do we need to discuss?
- What happens if…?
- What would need to happen…?
- How would you like me to do that?
- How long do you want to try that?
- How will you know…?
- How do you see that happening?
- How do you want to handle this?
- How are you going to decide?
- How do you see this playing out?
- How are you going to feel if…?
- How have you done this in the past?
- How do you like to…?

## Don’t Take the Bait


This chapter has been all about asking questions. That’s how you focus on the other person—it’s standing shoulder to shoulder and seeing what they’re seeing. It’s a huge part of the trust-building process.


But, as you already know, salespeople like to answer questions, not ask them. You’ve been trained that your value is in having all the answers. You think: If I don’t have the answer, why would anyone work with me?


So, you jump to answer questions because it’s a chance to demonstrate your value…especially when they ask, “What do you think?” That’s your favorite one.


Don’t take the bait!


Your clients don’t want to know what you think. They only want to know if you think what they think. They already have something in mind, but they’re just not ready to commit to it quite yet.


The real question is, why do they want to know what you think? This is the moment to find out. What’s the thought that’s already in their mind, and what are their feelings around it? If they’re not confident in their decision yet, where is that uncertainty coming from? What are they afraid of, and what other information do they need to move forward?


Labels and calibrated questions will help you find out. Tailor them to the situation—start with a phrase like “It seems like you have doubts about…” or “What would you need to know to decide…” and fill in the specifics. Keep going until you have a clear understanding of why they’re stuck.


That’s how you help them get unstuck—not by simply making a recommendation but by digging down to the root of the issue and solving it at that level.


In the end, it’s always on you to put the ball back in their court: “If it were me, this is what I would do…But it’s not me, it’s you, and it’s your decision to make. How do you want to proceed?”

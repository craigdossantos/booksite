It’s time to get your humanity—and your life—back.


Congratulate yourself! You’ve made it all the way to the end of this book, which means you were open-minded enough and value yourself enough to consider a new way of doing things. It probably seemed insane at first. Certainly, most of the things you’ve learned go completely against what agents typically do, and there are plenty of people who would tell you you’re crazy to try this.


Hopefully, you’ve been paying close enough attention to realize by now that while it may be scary to change, it’s the sanest decision you will ever make. To quote Frank Zappa, “Without deviation from the norm, progress is not possible.”


Before, you were turning yourself into a commodity. You spent all your time chasing clients, convincing them to do what you want, and pushing everyone to close the deal. Chase, convince, close, over and over in a never-ending cycle of fear, attachment, hope, and disappointment. In your eagerness for more clients, more revenue, more prestige, more everything…you made yourself a slave to the transaction.


It’s time to get your humanity—and your life—back.


It starts with recognizing how people actually think and make decisions. We’re not machines who see the world without bias and weigh all the pros and cons mathematically. We’re human beings with feelings and brains that have evolved to keep us alive, not to be unbiased. If there’s one thing about human nature you always remember, let it be this: you can’t overcome emotion with fact, logic, and reason.


Because of that, and because there’s no such thing as an open mind, you’ve completely transformed the way you approach prospects. There is no convincing anyone to hire you—their minds are already made up. All you have to do is find out whether you’re the Favorite or the Fool. When you use Tactical Empathy to make them feel understood, they’ll reveal the answer to you. Instead of spending days on a listing appointment, you figure out within half an hour whether you really have a shot. If not, you happily walk away and save your time for the people who want to work with you.


Now, in every client relationship, you have a new focus: building trust. Gone are the days of explaining your value and giving away your time, effort, and money to win people over. You know now that the indirect route is faster. By building trust, you pave the way for every future interaction to be easier, more productive, and more joyful. All you have to do is let go of your own feelings and desires, then focus your complete attention on the other person. It’s that simple.


You’re not scared of tough conversations anymore, either. You used to avoid or sugarcoat them, but that just undermined your clients’ trust in you. Now, you call out the negatives and break bad news as soon as possible, gently and with confidence. You’ve learned how to brace them for it and use Accusations Audits to make them feel understood. You’ve also used Accusations Audits to examine your own feelings and set them aside, so you can focus on the other person.


You’ve also stopped taking on responsibility for things that are outside your control. Before, you felt like it was your job to steer every choice and solve every problem. Now, you recognize that in the end, only the client can decide anything. Your job is just to be the trusted advisor who provides all the information they need to make informed, empowered choices. Your stress, angst, and frustration don’t help—they just get in the way. So, you let it go and focus on guiding the client’s decisions, not owning them.


To do that effectively, you’ve learned to start with no instead of pushing for yes. People hate to say yes—it makes them feel vulnerable and puts them on guard. Saying no, on the other hand, protects them and preserves their autonomy. After they say no, they’re more open to hearing what you have to say. So, to guide your client, you begin with no-oriented questions. Then, you use calibrated (how and what) questions to help them think through tough issues and share what they truly want and don’t want.


You’ve learned to use these Tactical Empathy techniques all the time, from the beginning of the relationship to the end—especially the end. The last impression is the lasting impression, and people who walk away feeling good about you are more likely to come back and refer other people to you. That’s exactly what you need to build a sustainable business. So, you follow the Oprah Rule: send everyone away in a limo, no matter what.


All of this comes together in one single moment of truth: the commission conversation. It’s the most important conversation you have with your clients, and the one that agents dread the most…but not you, because now you’re a full-service, full fee agent. Your standard is 6 percent, and you stick to it 100 percent of the time. It’s not because you’re greedy. It’s because charging 6 percent forces you to do everything else you’ve learned in this book. It challenges you to be the best agent you can be every day, and it rewards you with a business that’s a joy instead of a drain on your life.


This book is not about following a series of steps to get what you want. It’s about showing up as a human being who’s here to serve other human beings, with no other agenda. You don’t have to be a real estate machine who sacrifices their personal life and happiness to do business. You can be authentic and real, and that’s the way to do more business in way less time, with way less stress. Instead of just surviving, you can start living your highest and best.


Remember, how you do business is more important than how much business you do. When you focus on the how, the score will take care of itself.


## Start By Letting Go


I’ve said it over and over in this book, and I’ll say it again: your feelings and desires have no place here. They are getting in your way. Start by letting them go.


You’ve been conditioned your whole life to believe that if you want something good to happen, you have to make it happen. You have to convince people to follow you and fight against everything that blocks your path. It’s a constant battle between you and the universe, and you must get your way.


As Michael Singer put it in his book, The Surrender Experiment:


The battle between individual will and the reality of life unfolding around us ends up consuming our lives. When we win the battle, we are happy and relaxed; when we don’t, we’re disturbed and stressed. Since most of us only feel good when things are going our way, we are constantly attempting to control everything in our lives.


That is not a peaceful existence. You spend all your time fighting to get what you think you need to be happy, but it’s the fight itself that’s killing your happiness.


With this book, you’ve learned how to stop fighting.


You’re not here to make something happen. Instead, you show up, giving your highest and best to what is happening. How many times have you read those words already? If you take them to heart, it will take all the stress and struggle out of your work. Your business will transform from something that drains your life force to something that brings you joy and peace.


None of this is just about business either. Humans are humans, and our minds work the same in business and in our personal lives. Every single thing you’ve learned can apply just as well to your spouse, your kids, your parents, or your friends as it does to your clients. Tactical Empathy can transform all your relationships, if you let it.


## Three Things to Master


Tactical Empathy is a learned skill, and to start using it in your business, your habits have to change. If you’re like most of the agents we coach, you’re used to winging your client conversations and getting by on personality. That’s not going to cut it anymore.


Replacing old habits with new ones takes deliberate practice. If you let yourself wing it, you’ll default to your old ways and never make progress.


We’ve hit you with a lot of new skills in this book, and we don’t expect you to master them all at once. These are the three you need to start with. The conversation hasn’t really begun until these three things happen.


### 1. Prepare.


Get in the habit of taking time each day to anticipate upcoming conversations and write down what the other person will likely be thinking and feeling. Then, write down what you’re thinking and feeling, including all your hopes and fears about the outcome of the conversation…and let them go. They don’t matter, and they will only get in your way.


Whatever the interaction is—talking to a prospect, hosting an open house, writing an offer—prepare your mind to focus on the other person.


### 2. Read the situation.


Your old habit was to show up ready to push your agenda. Instead, you need to show up ready to read the other person. Focus exclusively on them and pay attention to the details—not just what they’re saying but also their body language, tone of voice, and what they’re not saying. Preparation makes this easier because it helps you know what to look for, just as reading scouting reports helped me read the situation on the field when I was in the NFL.


### 3. Make them feel understood.


Your only goal is to get them to say “that’s right.” Use mirrors and labels to elicit more information and confirm your understanding until you sense that emotional click, when you get in alignment with them. That’s how you know you’ve successfully crossed to their side of the street and seen the world from their perspective.


## It’s Hard…Until It’s Not


I have a coaching client who is supposed to do expired listing calls every day, as part of his prospecting plan. He never does it, and every time we talk about it, he dreads it more and more.


Every day you don’t do something, it gets harder. But when you let go of your excuses and just do it, it keeps getting easier.


I’ll give you an extreme example from my personal life. A while back, I got a Peloton and pledged to ride it every single day. I started at five or ten miles a day and worked my way up to sixty.


Then, I thought: what if I rode one hundred miles a day for one hundred days?


It knew it would be hard at first. I had only ridden one hundred miles twice, once back in my twenties, and once on the Peloton a few months prior. But, I wanted to know how riding one hundred miles would feel after I had done it one hundred times.


Instead of approaching it with unhelpful thoughts and feelings about what I expected (This is going to be so hard…I’m not sure I have the energy for this today…I’m already sore from yesterday…blah, blah, blah), I got on the bike each day with an attitude of surrender.


I had made the commitment. I had no choice but to be there, on that bike, riding one hundred miles. I wasn’t there to make something happen, but to discover what would happen. How would it feel to ride one hundred miles today?


Day one? Not so bad. Day two? Not so bad. Day three? Same thing.


By the time I had done it ten times, it was easy. There was no question I could do it.


That’s what I’m asking you to do with Tactical Empathy. Commit to the decision to do it, and surrender to that commitment. Just do it—feel the fear, let it go, and do it anyway. There’s a big difference between wondering if you can do it and working to get better. The first is a never-ending trap. The second lets you feed off the progress.


Forming new habits means building new neural pathways and using them over and over. The more you use them, the stronger they get, and the more your old pathways atrophy. When the new ones are stronger than the old ones, you have a new habit.


To make this happen, you’ve got to put in the reps.


Find low-stakes situations where you can practice these skills without taking big risks. Role play with your colleagues. Apply them in your personal life. At an open house, pick one label and use it on everyone who comes in, and practice reading whether they’re a serious buyer or not.


When I first started practicing Tactical Empathy, I had to really think about it every time, and it felt unnatural. I just kept at it, and the awkwardness dissipated. Now, my brain is totally rewired, and it’s almost effortless.


But it doesn’t take years to get comfortable with this. Most of the time, it only takes a few reps to tip the balance from awkward and painful to exciting and fun.


For example, Chris has a technique based on Tactical Empathy for getting free upgrades at hotels. When he traveled for the first time after the COVID shutdown, he was reluctant to use it, even though he knew it was effective.


Unhelpful thoughts and feelings were running through his mind: I don’t have the energy for this…I’m out of practice…It probably won’t work anyway.


But he surrendered to his commitment to Tactical Empathy and did it anyway. It’s just three simple steps:


1. “I’m getting ready to ruin your whole day.” Brace the concierge for bad news.


2. “I know I’m about to sound like a self-centered, demanding traveler who is so self-involved that they want something for nothing.” Do a quick Accusations Audit.


3. “How much trouble will you get in if you give me a free upgrade to a suite?” Use a calibrated question to make them think about your request from a fresh perspective. The answer is usually none, which makes them happy to do it.


It worked. In fact, it worked at eight out of the nine hotels he stayed in on that trip, and it only failed in a hotel where all the rooms were suites anyway. After the fourth time, he no longer felt even the slightest internal resistance to doing it.


Give yourself at least four tries. By the fourth rep, it will feel noticeably easier than the first time. That’s enough motivation to keep you going to the tenth rep, and the twentieth, and the hundredth, until you’ve lost count and it’s just how you do business.


## Let Yourself Transform


Most agents have figured out how to do business. They just haven’t figured out how to do business and have a life.


When my coaching clients start practicing Tactical Empathy and experiencing the results, they start asking a whole new set of questions. I have all this time…what do I do? Can I really just relax and watch Netflix? Should I get a hobby? Get a dog? Start dating again?


If you’re one of the many, many real estate agents who has let your business take over your entire life, this will be you. It might sound funny when you read it, but this is serious stuff. These people are finally confronting the question: If I’m not just my business, who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing with my life?


That’s how deep this really goes.


Tactical Empathy is not just another way to marginally improve your business results and go on your merry way. It is transformational. It changes everything: your relationships, your business, and your entire life.


We challenge you to let it change you.


Just like the clients who come to me for coaching, you picked up this book because you know you can do better. You know deep down that you’re not a commodity; you’re more than your production, and your clients are more than a paycheck.


You’re a human being, here to serve other human beings.

How you do business is more important than how much business you do.


On a Saturday afternoon in the fall of 2016, everything I thought I knew about selling real estate went out the window.


I was by no means new to the business. Over the previous twenty-five years, I had sold real estate in high volume, grown real estate startups and training companies, and owned a successful real estate brokerage that I helped build from scratch. Most importantly, I had coached the best of the best in the industry for decades, constantly perfecting my methods to help agents take the next step in their business and reach heights they once thought impossible. I studied real estate agents nonstop, and there was probably no one else on the planet earth who understood them better.


After living and breathing real estate for that long, I was convinced I had this thing wired from beginning to end. If you wanted a straightforward blueprint for achieving greatness, I served it up on a platter…or so I thought.


I was wrong. That day, I realized I had to rewrite the playbook from scratch.


It wasn’t the first time I found myself taking on a radical life change virtually overnight. I did it when a knee injury cut my professional football career short after just four years with the Miami Dolphins. I did it when I finished my MBA and took a job on Wall Street, and again when I left that job to start my own trading company with a colleague.


The world of finance wasn’t my final stop, though. Sometime in 1990, someone gave me a recorded interview of two Long Beach, California real estate agents, Kim and Daryl Rouse. This duo was articulate, energetic, and dynamic. They had a plan, they knew how to execute it, and in just their second year as agents, they were on track to sell one hundred homes. Given that the average agent sells four to six homes per year, that was impressive stuff.


As I listened to the interview, something clicked inside me. Everything they were saying made total sense. It was all repeatable. I could envision myself doing the same thing, and generating the same result.


That was all the spark I needed for another radical change. So in 1991, I packed up all my belongings and headed to Southern California—Fullerton, to be exact. I didn’t know anyone or anything about real estate, but the interview with Kim and Daryl just kept playing in my head: contacts equal leads…leads equal appointments…appointments equal listings…listings equal sales!


That progression was going to be my new life. I was a man on a mission, and as usual for me, there was no Plan B—I just assumed I would succeed. (Some say that successful people have a certain delusional quality about them, and I tend to agree.)


I wasn’t trying to reinvent the wheel. I attended many seminars and workshops, listened intently to one top agent after another, and did exactly what they were doing. I was motivated, disciplined, and looking for any edge I could get. Because of my sports background, I was no stranger to hard work and didn’t struggle with the idea that I needed to prospect three to five hours a day. My goal was to make fifty contacts every day, and that was simply what had to get done.


I could hardly have picked a worse year to start this career. At one point, my partner and I had forty listings and no escrows. If four people walked into an open house, it was a huge success. “Multiple offers” meant buyers were writing offers on multiple properties to see where they could get the best deal. Most listings took somewhere between ninety days and a year to sell—if they sold at all. Times were scary, and it was hard not to second guess my decision to become a real estate agent.


But after knocking on 200 doors a day, five days a week, and calling every expired listing every day, the momentum finally kicked in. By the end of 1991, my first year in real estate, my partner and I had closed fifty-three transactions in one of the most difficult markets ever.


In my second year, I came up with the idea of creating a coaching program for agents. I knew what worked, I had put it into practice, and I believed I could help other people do the same. To my knowledge, at that point, there was no such thing as real estate coaching—plenty of speakers and trainers, but no coaches.


So, I teamed up with one the biggest speakers in the business, and that’s how the first real estate coaching program was born. It took off almost immediately. When we first introduced the program to a Coldwell Banker office in Las Vegas, we signed up nine agents. Then, at a much larger workshop in San Francisco, we signed up ninety more.


The original format was a fifteen-minute phone call every other week for one hundred dollars per month, and agents completed a daily activity report and faxed it to me every week. The fax machine was going nonstop, as were my coaching calls. Soon, my schedule was filled with clients, and we hired nine other full-time coaches.


This was what I was meant to do—not sell real estate myself but help other agents become the best they could be. I’m a coach at heart, and my curiosity and desire to figure out this industry never fades. So, in 1996, I went out on my own and formed Performance Coaching, and I stayed the course for two decades…until that day in the fall of 2016.


That was the day I started reading a book a coaching client had given to me: Never Split the Difference by Chris Voss (the coauthor of this book). In that bestseller, Chris shared the negotiation strategies he had learned over two decades as a hostage negotiator for the FBI. When the book came out in 2016, it completely upended the prevailing wisdom on negotiation, calling into question the logic-driven, yes-focused methods everyone took for granted. Since then, it has become the go-to guide for business negotiators everywhere, and Chris is one of the most sought-after negotiation trainers in the world.


The title was what drew me in. Never split the difference? In real estate deals, agents almost always ended up splitting the difference! If that was a flawed strategy, I had to find out why. Just like the 1990 interview with the two Long Beach agents, Chris’s book turned out to be a life changer.


Up to that point, I had viewed real estate as a linear process, just as I had been taught from the beginning. Nuts and bolts 101. Looking at the business through the lens of fact, logic, and reason, everything could be synthesized into a foolproof series of clearly defined actions. There was no emotional component to my calculations because emotions just got in the way of rationality.


Big mistake.


Thanks to Chris, I finally saw what I had been overlooking: you can’t overcome emotion with fact, logic, and reason.


Chris’s message hit me like a lightning bolt. The approach I had been using for my entire career was completely backwards. I had been trying to eliminate the volatile emotions inherent in the real estate business, but that’s impossible—it’s simply against human nature. You can’t overcome emotion with fact, logic, and reason.


## FOMO and the Temptation of More


In short, I had gotten really good at doing the wrong thing. It worked—my clients got great results…but only by repeatedly conquering a problem they could have been avoiding altogether.


I call that problem the agent’s doom loop: chase, convince, and close.


Virtually every agent lives in this cycle. It’s not what you signed up for—if you’re like most agents, you got into this industry to earn a six-figure income, be your own boss, and have flexibility in your schedule. But in reality, that six-figure income is elusive, being your own boss is harder than you ever imagined, and “flexibility” really means being on call 24/7.


Why? Because of fear.


That’s the real driving force in the residential real estate industry. To be more precise, it’s the fear of missing out (a.k.a. FOMO). Why else do you work the way you work? You don’t chase on a daily basis for the thrill of it. You don’t convince because you love twisting arms. You don’t take every opportunity to close because you think people love being pressured.


You do all this because you fear what will happen if you don’t. As human beings, we’ve been conditioned to believe that our inside world is directly related to the outside world. As a result, we spend our entire lives trying to get the outside world to line up in a way that makes us feel good on the inside. If we can achieve certain external results, we’ll finally be happy.


That’s a nice story, but it’s simply not true. In reality, the inside and outside world operate independently from each other. The world will go on the way it does regardless of how you feel about it, and no external results will ever bring the lasting joy and inner peace you crave in your life.


This isn’t just idle philosophy—the doom loop is a direct byproduct of this false way of thinking. You’re a commissioned salesperson. You only get paid when you close a sale. The prospect of not getting that result sends your mind to all the dark places. Unconsciously, you think that your business will fail…you’ll go broke…you’ll starve…you’ll die. This may sound like a gross exaggeration, but for most real estate agents, this is their life. No money equals death.


This way of thinking and feeling puts you in full-on survival mode. You chase, convince, and close as if your life depends on it because in your mind, it actually does. But the more you follow this doom loop, the more you push people away, which then fuels more feelings around lack and limitation. It’s a never-ending cycle of doom and gloom.


So, with a market that’s overflowing with licensed agents, fear has you running ragged in search of legitimate opportunities, trying to grab a piece of the pie before it disappears.


The problem is, most of your leads turn out to be wild goose chases that never turn into real business. In fact, probably 80 percent of your time gets wasted on work that generates exactly zero revenue (but plenty of frustration and heartbreak).That high-cost, low-return activity is a drain on your time, energy, and bank account, but it feels like a requirement. How else are you supposed to get any clients?


So you chase, chase, chase. Convince, convince, convince. Close, close, close. Rinse and repeat.


And the solution to every problem always feels the same: just do one more deal. How many times have you said it to yourself? If I can just do one more deal, everything will be okay. Forget “location, location, location”—the true refrain in this business is “more, more, more!”


Would it be ridiculous to say all the training you’ve received has been focused on how to get some version of “more” in your business? More contacts, leads, appointments, buyers, listings, sales, money, market share, rankings, time, people working for you. Fill in the blank as you like.


It’s hard to not be seduced by the prospect of more. It sounds so wonderful…but it’s usually a trap. More rarely solves anything. It only leads to more desire. If you do what you’ve been taught, you might increase your productivity, but the stress and struggle will not disappear. Ultimately, you’ll be left in the same place you are now, wanting and thinking you need to do more. It’s a never-ending cycle that leads to mental and emotional exhaustion.


On top of that, whether you realize it or not, every force imaginable is conspiring to turn you into a commodity. This is the biggest trap of all, and no one is immune. Industry “best practices” manipulate you into thinking that to win business, you must work harder, spend more money, give away your most valuable information, promise more than you can deliver, and charge less than you deserve. You’re forced into a transactional perspective that pits your ambition against your integrity.


That’s a formula for burnout if there ever was one.


## The Missing Piece


You know who doesn’t burn out?


Tom Brady.


Even if you’ve never watched a single football game in your life, I bet you know who he is: the winningest quarterback in NFL history, with more Super Bowl victories (seven) than any other player or team. In twenty-two seasons in the NFL, he has suffered only one serious injury, and at age forty-four, he shows no signs of slowing down.


That longevity is no accident, and it has more to do with your longevity in real estate than you might think.


As Brady explained in his book, The TB12 Method: How to Achieve a Lifetime of Sustained Peak, the normal cycle for athletes is to train, play, get hurt, and rehab, over and over. The problem is that typical fitness models emphasize strength and conditioning but are missing another crucial piece: pliability. Pliability removes the tension and stress from the training process, eliminating the main cause of injury.



- In Never Split the Difference, I found the missing piece for real estate agents: Tactical Empathy.

To explain what that means, let me back up a step. Remember, you can’t overcome emotion with fact, logic, and reason…but you can work with those emotions to do business in a more authentic and effective way. You can learn from what works in other high-stakes, emotional situations (like the hostage negotiations Chris knows so well), and use it to make the real estate business work better for everyone—you and the buyers and sellers who hire you.


I can’t emphasize it enough: emotion is what really drives decisions in real estate. You’re shepherding buyers and sellers through one of the most stressful and significant decisions of their lives, and everyone’s hopes and dreams are on the line. Buyers are hoping to find the perfect home for a bargain, and sellers are hoping to make a boatload of money on the asset they’ve been lovingly maintaining for years. On top of that, you want a painless deal that satisfies everyone, pays you a respectable commission, and generates repeat and referral business in the future.


But when it comes to sales training for agents, the science and skill of dealing with emotions (both yours and those of your prospects and clients) is practically nonexistent. Scripted presentations, objection handlers, and closing dialogues still rule the day. Emotional intelligence rarely gets a mention, and empathy never.


Instead, you’re taught to win clients by explaining your value: your track record, market insight, pricing strategy, resources, connections, time commitment, and of course, your discounted fee. One by one, you present the factual, logical reasons why you’re the best for the job…and your prospects smile and thank you profusely and never call you again. Every conversation is like an unwinnable tug-of-war: you’re trying to pull them over to your side with fact, logic, and reason, but the harder you pull, the more they resist.


How many times have you left an appointment with no clue whether you had a real shot at getting the listing? How many times did you think you had it in the bag, only to find out later that they went with someone else? Why does this happen?


Because you didn’t make them feel understood.


Not that you didn’t understand them. I’m sure you did. You just didn’t make them feel understood.


It’s almost the same thing Stephen Covey said in The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People: “Seek first to understand, then to be understood.” What he forgot to mention was that understanding doesn’t count for anything until the other person believes you understand them. You know what they say when that happens?


“That’s right.”


As in, “That’s right, you are now seeing the world from my perspective and speaking my language. You get me.”


Reaching “that’s right” requires Tactical Empathy: the art of influencing others by articulating what they’re thinking and feeling, without necessarily agreeing, disagreeing, or sympathizing.

The art of influencing others by articulating what they’re thinking and feeling, without necessarily agreeing, disagreeing, or sympathizing.


Just as pliability removes tension from athletic training, Tactical Empathy takes the stress out of real estate sales. It cuts off the agent’s doom loop before it even starts—no more endless rounds of chasing, convincing, and closing.


## From Explaining Value to Building Trust


This is what no one else is teaching. It’s the master key to constructing a real estate business based on building trust instead of explaining value.


When you explain your value, you become a commodity engaged in pushing transactions. Brutal, but honest.


When you cultivate trust, you become an irreplaceable advisor who creates strong relationships that yield a constant flow of repeat and referral business. Would you be opposed to hustling less while enjoying your work more and reaping bigger financial rewards? That’s what trust does for you.


Forget just surviving—the methodology you’re about to learn is going to make you feel alive in a brand new way. It will teach you how to become the trusted advisor your clients want, need, and will actually hire. Our approach builds on the most comprehensive scientific understanding of how people actually make decisions.


Spoiler alert: rational calculations are just the tip of the iceberg.


Below the surface are complex layers of biases, tendencies, and other brain phenomena that often make human behavior seem anything but logical. Whether you’re aware of it or not (and most people aren’t), these things affect your every move, from how you interpret a client’s comment to what you choose to eat for lunch. Over the last few decades, researchers have tested and explained these patterns in ways that completely change how we think about influencing people.


Foreign as these ideas may be in real estate, they’ve already revolutionized other industries and been validated over and over by scientific studies. What you’re about to learn is a more human, authentic, and honest way to sell real estate, which is precisely why it works so well.


Just imagine: what if your ambition didn’t have to compete with your integrity? What if you could work in a way that aligned with your core values, beliefs, and principles? What if you could do well, be well, and help others at the same time?


Right now, you probably feel like most of what you say to your clients and prospects falls on deaf ears. When you master Tactical Empathy—the art of making people feel understood—they will finally start to hear you. Then, instead of pushing them to follow your advice, you can gently guide them in the right direction they need to go to get what they want…with them thinking it’s their idea.


This book is about one simple, inescapable truth: how you do business is more important than how much business you do.


It sounds crazy on the surface, but you’re about to see that if you focus on the how, the how much will take care of itself.


## New Neural Pathways


When Chris and I started coaching together in late 2017, I made an immediate 180-degree pivot in my coaching practice, incorporating Chris’s knowledge into everything I taught my clients. I couldn’t not do that—the truth is the truth. When you hear it, it is virtually impossible to resist.


It was a seismic shift. We were laying waste to the foundation of the real estate business, turning every norm upside down, and we didn’t have any hard proof yet that it would work for this industry. It had to be the right direction, though. Human nature doesn’t care what industry you’re in.


Just enough people believed in our conviction that we could start proving the theory. It wasn’t easy—a paradigm shift never is. At first, people tried to apply these new ideas to the old way of doing things, using new language to keep chasing, convincing, and closing better. That’s not how this works. If you try to do it halfway, it will fail.


But when you do it right, it’s rocket fuel for your business.


Our clients have shown us time and time again that this stuff transforms careers. They do more business, but more importantly, they do it in a better way. They have less stress and more time and energy. Every deal comes easier, and leaves all parties feeling happier when it’s done. The tough conversations that used to keep them up at night now come effortlessly. Nobody wants to be a pushy salesperson, and what we teach allows them to leave that behind forever…and be more successful than they were before.


Agents come to us with all the usual struggles: how to win more clients, manage their workloads, navigate tough conversations, close deals faster, and get better outcomes from those deals. When they learn to use Tactical Empathy as the foundation for everything they do, all those problems start to solve themselves.


You’ll see it in the real-life stories we’ve included in this book, and you’ll find out firsthand when you try these strategies yourself. The beauty is that they work immediately. Unlike learning a new sport or musical instrument, you don’t have to practice for months before you can be effective. As soon as you start using Tactical Empathy, people will start responding to you differently. It can literally change the course of your career overnight.


That said, this is a new skill, and you will feel awkward at first. It’s not complicated, and it doesn’t take any special genius, but learning to use it is going to be uncomfortable and unnatural. It will go against everything you think you know about how to do your job, and you’re going to think there’s no way this stuff will work…but it does.


Feel the fear, and commit to doing it anyway. Every time you do, you’ll strengthen the new neural pathways in your brain, and if you keep at it, soon what was once very unnatural will become second nature. That’s when radical change becomes not just possible, but inevitable.


This book touches on every aspect of your relationship with a client, from the first conversation to the last impression. In each chapter, we’ll examine the usual way of doing things and see how Tactical Empathy turns it on its head—and leads to wildly better results. You’ll get the combined benefit of my industry experience and Chris’s unparalleled negotiation expertise, plus evidence from scientific studies and examples from the agents we coach.


Practice as you go, and by the end of the book, you’ll never want to do business without Tactical Empathy again.

### Key Takeaways



- As a salesperson, you’re trained to get to yes, and it feels great when you do. But for the customer, saying yes makes them feel vulnerable and wary.
- What people really want to say is no because it feels safe. No preserves the status quo and protects their autonomy.
- So, begin with no-oriented questions. Once they’ve said no, they’ll be more open to your guidance.
- Then, use calibrated questions to prompt them to think deeply and share their thoughts with you.
- If they ask what you think, don’t take the question at face value. Dig deeper to uncover what they’re already thinking, and why they feel uncertain about it.

## Tactical Empathy Toolbox



- No-Oriented Questions: Questions designed to elicit a no response, where no moves the conversation forward instead of shutting it down.
- Calibrated Questions: Open-ended questions (usually beginning with how or what) designed to put the other person in an open frame of mind towards you.

### Key Takeaways



- By the time prospects call you, you’re either the Favorite or the Fool. Your only goal is to find out which one.
- Develop your cold reading skills to spot patterns of behavior that indicate you’re the Favorite. Your chances are high if:- they called you specifically and can articulate why,- you fit the profile of people they’ve worked with before,- you connect emotionally with them,- it’s a two-way conversation, and- they’re willing to commit up front to working with you.
- Only play at the table where the odds are in your favor. If you’re the Fool, walk away gracefully before you waste any more time.

## Tactical Empathy Toolbox



- Cold Reading: Paying close attention to the other person’s words, tone, and body language to recognize patterns and predict their future behavior.
- Labeling: Stating what the other person is thinking or feeling, using a phrase like “It seems like…” or “You’re probably thinking/feeling…”
- Mirroring: Repeating the last few words the other person just said, which often prompts them to expand on that train of thought.

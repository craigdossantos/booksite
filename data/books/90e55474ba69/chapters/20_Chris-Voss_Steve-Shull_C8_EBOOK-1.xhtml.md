### Key Takeaways



- Everything you’ve learned so far comes together in the most important discussion you’ll have with any client: the commission conversation.
- If you’re the Favorite, they’ll agree to your fee. If you’re not, it doesn’t matter what your fee is—they probably won’t hire you anyway.
- There are all kinds of excuses for giving discounts, but none of them hold water. You and your clients are both better off if you stick to the standard of 6 percent, no exceptions.
- Typical scripts for this conversation use facts, logic, and reason to try to convince the prospect of your worth. Throw them in the trash. Instead, use what you’ve learned about Tactical Empathy to lay out the issue and guide their decision.
- This is your moment of truth, where you either challenge yourself to become a full-service, full fee agent with a business built on trust…or you get stuck in the status quo.

## From Steve Shull


As a former professional football player, every year I look forward to the NFL Hall of Fame induction ceremonies. I love listening to the speeches given by each new gold jacket recipient, and what I love most is how each new Hall of Fame member says thank you to all the people in their lives that have made this accomplishment possible. Unfortunately, I am never going into the NFL Hall of Fame. However, in writing this book with my coauthor Chris Voss, I am now getting my chance to say thank you and acknowledge all the people who have influenced me greatly along my life journey.


First, I want to start with Chris Voss. As I share in the following pages, reading Chris’s book Never Split The Difference was a real game changer for me. The moment I read the book, I knew I had to reach out to Chris, and the book you are about to read is the byproduct of all the work we have done together over the past five years. I thank you, Chris, and I know all my clients thank you as well.


And speaking of clients, I want to make a huge shout out to a very select group of coaching clients who have supported me and believed in me and worked with me for a very long time. All my clients are valuable and important to me, however this group has a very special place in my heart and mind: Vickey England, Terri and David Elston, Elaine Stucy (who wrote the forward), Stephanie Younger, Sally Forster Jones, Linda May, Jeffrey and Nadia Saad, Regina Vannicola, Mark Javonovich and Scott Hustis, and Dana Green and Santiago Arana. You are my Hall of Fame clients, and it has been the greatest privilege to work with each of you.


Another group of special people I want to thank include my football coaches: Pal Allison (high school); Lou Tepper, Wally Ake, and Jim Root (college); and Steve Crosby, Bill Arnsbarger, and Don Shula (professional). All of these men believed in me and taught me lessons I use every day in my coaching practice and life.


The following individuals have also been important teachers and mentors in my life, directly and indirectly: Pete Certo, David Allen, Fred Wilson, Betty Graham, Larry Kendall, Robert Reffkin, Ryan Holiday, Patrick Sweeny, and Michael Singer. Your wisdom is greatly appreciated.


And since I am not sure when I will get this chance again, I would like to make a heartfelt mention of my early childhood heroes: Johnny Callison, Wilt Chamberlain, Arnold Palmer, and Muhammad Ali. All of you stoked my imagination in a very significant way.


Next is my best friend in life, Jamie Leder: You have always been by my side, no matter what. I love you, man.


To Madison Fitzpatrick: I hope you know this book wouldn’t have gotten written without you. THANK YOU!!


To Danielle Lazier and Sean McGlynn: thank you for being the pioneers and early adopters of this new methodology.


To my Dad: I was probably way too tough on you in life, but I always realized you were my biggest cheerleader.


To my mom: thank you for always reminding me and challenging me to be better.


To my brother and sister: The journey is not over yet. Let’s all stay open to what’s next.


To my incredible daughters, Sophia and Sasha: Talk about keeping a man honest! You are my heartbeat and my touchstone. I love you both so dearly, and hopefully you know you are a big part of this book.


Finally, to the love of my life, my wife Katerina: Without your never-ending support and encouragement (code for your foot up my ass), none of what I do is possible. You are my coach, and I love you for it!

This book would not have been possible without Brandon Voss and the entire Black Swan Group team. Brandon met Steve and told me, “You have to talk with this guy. We should work with him.” He was right. Then, the entire Black Swan Group team, Vannessa Bernal in particular, kicked into gear and supported all our efforts. If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go as a team. Thank you, Team Black Swan!

Steve Shull is a former linebacker for the Miami Dolphins. When an injury forced him to change his game—literally—he pivoted into finance, then real estate, and found his calling when he started coaching other agents. Twenty-three years later, he read a book by Chris Voss, tossed out his playbook, and redesigned the whole program from scratch.


Chris Voss served as the lead international kidnapping negotiator for the FBI. His business negotiation book Never Split the Difference has sold millions of copies around the world. After twenty-four years with the Bureau, he founded The Black Swan Group to help realtors, companies, and individuals take their negotiation skills to the next level.

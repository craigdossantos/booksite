##### Chapter 7.  Nail the Lasting Impression


Send people away in a limo, and there’s a good chance they’ll come back.


Imagine you’re representing a seller at the end of a deal. You’ve got an offer from a serious buyer, you got the inspection done, and you’ve spent a week going back and forth, trying to get both parties to a place where they can agree. You’ve resolved every negotiation point and are only $3,000 apart on price.


So, you do what most agents would do: you split the difference. The seller and the buyer each eat $1,500. It’s a simple, fair solution, right? Your client doesn’t love it, but you convince them it’s the only surefire way to close the deal. They agree to it because you’ve invested weeks into this process now, and the last thing they want is to relist and start again from scratch.


Finally, the deal is done. It only took two months from the time the seller contacted you. They wanted to sell quickly, so you see that as a huge win. Plus, they got almost their full asking price and only had to make a few repairs. You think they should be thrilled— thrilled enough to work with you again in the future, or send referrals your way.


But they’re not. They don’t say anything negative to your face, but they just don’t seem as ecstatic as you thought they’d be. You never hear from them again, and they never send anyone your way. What happened?


You didn’t think about the last impression. Everyone tells you to worry about first impressions because you only get one chance. Sure, but usually there’s at least a little time to recover if it doesn’t go well.


Not so with the last impression. That’s the feeling that sticks, and because it’s last, you really don’t get another chance. And for a business built on repeat and referral customers—as yours should be—you can’t afford to neglect the last impression.


In this story, everything went smoothly until the end of the deal. But what stuck in the client’s mind was that last concession, the one they were reluctant to make, but felt like they had to. It wasn’t even a lot of money in the grand scheme of things, but it felt bad, like the buyer got something they shouldn’t have, and you couldn’t prevent it. The seller got almost everything they wanted, but that sour taste from the end of the negotiation is what they’ll remember.


This happens all the time, and most of the time you don’t even know it. In this industry, 90 percent of buyers and sellers say they would work with the same agent again, but only 20 percent ever actually do. Yikes.


At the very beginning of this book, I showed you why repeat and referral business has to be the foundation of your work. It’s the only way to run a successful real estate business that allows you to actually enjoy your life. It’s a natural consequence of doing business as a human being instead of a commodity.


In this chapter, you’ll learn how to make sure your lasting impression is the kind that will bring people back for more.


## The Old Way: Every Closed Deal Is a Win


Agents love closing deals. It’s what puts money in their pocket and sends their production numbers up. It’s what they brag about. It’s what they live for.


For an agent, every closed deal brings a massive sigh of relief. There’s always the chance that all your hard work could come to nothing at the last minute. When it doesn’t, that’s cause for celebration. You assume that your clients feel the same way.


They might…but they might not. It’s not about how close the deal ended up being to what they originally wanted. That would be logical, but as you already know, there’s way more going on in the human mind than just logic.


It’s about the quality of the emotional experience they had in getting to the deal, especially at the end. Did they feel like they were fully informed and in control of their decisions, or like they were roped into things they weren’t really okay with? Did they feel like they made the right trade-offs to get what really mattered to them, or like they gave up more than they should have? Do they feel you protected their interests and helped them make the right decisions, or you just wanted to get the deal done?


That’s what really matters.


So no, every closed deal is not a win. It’s only a win if the client feels like they won. It doesn’t matter what the deal looks like on paper—only their emotional experience of it. Your goal isn’t to close the deal. It’s to make sure they walk away happy, regardless of the business outcome.


## The New Way: Follow the Oprah Rule


The last impression is the lasting impression—Chris knew this intuitively from his hostage negotiation work, but he first heard it articulated and verified at a Gallup conference in 2008. You know Gallup, the company that does all those polls you hear about in the news. They had a mountain of data about human behavior and how people recall past events, and the evidence was right there.


People don’t remember how it happened. They remember the most intense moment and how it ended.


That explained why Chris and his FBI teammates had been able to get the upper hand in multiple hostage situations just by taking control of the end of each conversation with the kidnappers. If the kidnapper had a habit of hanging up with no warning or putting the call on hold, the FBI team focused on getting him to finish the conversation properly: say goodbye and hang up. That’s civilized and respectful behavior, and it completely changed the emotions and balance of power in the negotiation.


After the conference, Chris talked about the idea of the lasting impression with his friend Cindy Mori, who was Oprah’s booker at the time. “Of course,” she said. In most of the entertainment industry, you come in a limo and leave in a taxi. Not with Oprah. On her show, you come in a limo and leave in a limo, literally and figuratively.


Of the thousands of people who went on that show over twenty-five years, who comes to mind who has bad-mouthed Oprah? There were never any serious public spats or feuds, and any rumors along those lines disappeared quickly because her guests only ever had nice things to say about their experiences. People loved how it felt to go on Oprah as much as they loved to watch it, which is why she was able to get so many famous and powerful people to come back again and again.


That’s what you’re aiming for. Send people away in a limo, and there’s a good chance they’ll come back.


This doesn’t just apply to clients who close deals with you. It applies to everyone, no matter the circumstances under which they walk away from you. That includes prospects who decide not to work with you, and clients who decide to let their listings expire unsold or switch to another agent. It also includes other people who work with you, like the other party’s agent or vendors for things like home staging and repairs.


When people walk away happy, they come back again later, ready to collaborate with you again…and that makes your life so much easier.


You already know that customer acquisition costs are what really kill real estate agents. All the time and money you spend finding clients eats away at your bottom line like a termite infestation. But when a customer comes back for more or sends you a referral, that business lands in your lap practically for free. You need as much of that as you can get.


Plus, it’s much more productive and enjoyable to work with someone who already has a positive relationship with you, or at least a positive impression. Without that, they’re likely to be skeptical and guarded, which means you have to build trust from the ground up. It’s doable, as you’ve learned, but it takes time. Working within an existing trusting relationship is that much more efficient.


So, how are you going to make sure everyone walks away happy?


## Never Split the Difference™


Chris called his first book Never Split the Difference for good reason: everyone does it all the time, and it’s always a bad idea.


Real estate agents are the guiltiest of all. Splitting the difference is the default solution to every negotiation problem. We see it all the time—every single one of my coaching clients reacts with shock and confusion when they learn they need to stop doing it. Most of the time, they have no idea what else to do.


You probably think Chris and I are crazy. What could be more fair and reasonable than a fifty-fifty compromise?


But compromise is never equal.


Let’s go back to the story from the beginning of the chapter. When the seller agreed to split the $3,000 difference with the buyer, what really happened in their head?


Well, you learned in Chapter 1 that the pain of a loss is twice as powerful as the pleasure of an equivalent gain. So, that $1,500 loss felt like $3,000, whereas the other side only gave up half that. In theory, for your client to feel like the split was fair, they would give up just $1,000 while the other party ate $2,000. Splitting the difference down the middle is never going to feel good for your client.


When agents can’t split the difference—or don’t want to ask their client for another concession—they usually have one backup plan: chip in and cover the cost themselves. Agents are notorious for reaching in their own pockets to make a deal come together. You believe something is better than nothing, so to avoid losing the whole commission, you just sacrifice a little chunk of it.


You think you’re securing your business by chipping in, but in reality, you’re undermining it.


This is a sign that your business is based on explaining value, not building trust. Without trust, the only value you can offer that means anything to them is your time and money. So, to get as much out of you as possible, they treat you like a bank. Whenever they need your time or money to move the deal forward, they feel entitled to it. After all, that’s effectively what you promised.


You think you’re getting emotional bonus points for your generosity, but you’re not. You’re just setting the expectation that it’s okay for your clients to reach into your pocket. Plus, you’re confirming to them that your time is an unlimited free commodity and your money is cheap. What they perceive is that you can’t even make a deal come together without opening your own wallet.


In a trust-based business, the client doesn’t ask you to chip in. If you’ve built a strong relationship as their trusted advisor and consistently put the responsibility where it belongs, why would they? They understand that you’re here to educate, support, and protect them—not to pay their bills. They’re not looking for a discount because they know you’re worth every penny, and they wouldn’t want to disrespect you by implying that you don’t deserve your fee.


When the transaction is the only thing that matters, you’ll give things away to get it done. When the relationship is what matters most, you recognize that it’s not healthy for one party to feel entitled to stick their hand in the other’s pocket.


So, if you want your clients to feel like they’re riding away in a limo, you can’t split the difference, and you can’t just chip in to make the problem go away. You’ve got to do something different.


I don’t mean some kind of special negotiation tactic or closing trick. In fact, you’ve already learned exactly what to do.


## Make Them Feel Understood


That’s it: practice Tactical Empathy. Make them feel understood.


You did this at the beginning of the relationship, when you were finding out if you were the Favorite or the Fool. You did it when you were building trust, breaking bad news, and guiding them to make informed decisions. You need to keep doing it until the very end—especially at the very end.


The end of a deal process is a test of your commitment to Tactical Empathy. As you get closer and closer, you’ll be more and more tempted to default to your old salesperson habits. You’ll get impatient and start looking for the first opportunity to close, pushing everyone else, including your client, to get there faster. The fear will creep in, and bait you into throwing Tactical Empathy to the wind. This is why you often feel like no good deed goes unpunished.


Don’t give up.


Go back to what you’ve learned in this book. When you detach yourself from the outcome, you get out of your own way. Just give your best effort as an authentic human being who is here to serve others, and the results will take care of themselves.


How you behave at this stage should be no different from what you’ve done up to this point. First, you prepare for every conversation by thinking through (and ideally writing down) what everyone else is likely to be thinking and feeling.


For example, here are some things a potential seller might be thinking, in no specific order:



- Should I sell?
- What is my house worth?
- Will I get the price I want?
- Is now the right time to move?
- Does it make sense for me to sell my house in the current market?
- How much money will I net?
- What are closing costs?
- What other costs are associated with selling?
- What does the selling process look like?
- How much time will it take to sell my house?
- How involved do I have to be in this process?
- Will the process be stressful?
- What agents should I interview?
- Do I really need an agent?
- Can I sell the house myself?
- What is a standard commission for an agent?
- Will I have to hold open houses?
- What will my neighbors think?
- Am I making the right decision?
- Where will I move to?
- Where do I begin?
- How do I feel about this?
- Will this be difficult?
- How do I go about finding the right agent?
- Why are different agents giving me conflicting information?
- Why are agents telling me a different number than Zillow?
- Should I put money into updating my home?
- Can I sell my home as is?
- What will buyers think of my home?
- Are buyers going to ask for credits or repairs?
- Will I be sad to leave this home?
- How much work do I have to do?
- What if the house doesn’t sell?

Examine what you’re thinking and feeling as well, and recognize that your thoughts and feelings have no place here and won’t help you. Let them go.


Then, during the conversation, you listen with your full attention to the other person. Use mirroring, labeling, and mislabeling to elicit more information and make them feel heard. Aim to get to “that’s right.” When you feel that click of emotional alignment, you’ll know they feel understood.


That’s when you can start guiding them to where they want to go. Lay out the landscape for them: the facts of the present situation, the options they have, and the likely consequences of each option. Then, use calibrated questions to make them think about (and reveal to you) what they truly want and don’t want. Only they can decide what to do, so give them the space to do that with a simple question: How would you like to proceed?


Don’t fall into the trap of thinking your role as the expert is to tell them what to do. Even if they act like that’s what they want, it’s not. They’re just scared—this is a big decision, probably the biggest financial transaction of their life, and they don’t want to screw it up.


That doesn’t mean they actually want you to decide for them. They just want to feel empowered to make a decision with confidence.


The key to that isn’t giving your opinion or recommendation. It’s showing them the full decision landscape, and being transparent about the inherent uncertainties involved. Even you, the expert, can’t say 100 percent for sure what the consequences of any given decision will be. You can share your best educated guess, and be honest about your level of certainty around it.


Give them all the information you would consider if you were making the decision for yourself…but don’t make it. That’s their job. When you do that, they will feel supported and in charge of their own destiny.


At no point in time do you try to convince them of anything. Be patient. You’re not here to make something happen with fact, logic, and reason. You’re here to explore the unknown and find out what will happen.


## Limos for Everyone


That’s what makes people walk away with a positive emotional experience of interacting with you. It even works when they decide not to work with you.


For example, let’s say you’re talking to a prospect, and they’ve got their heart set on an inflated asking price. You strongly believe the house won’t sell at that price point, and you know it would be a waste of time and bad for the client relationship to accept the listing at that price, only to have to reduce it later.


So, you use the same process. First, you listen with your full attention and make them feel understood. Then you lay out the situation: your view is that the market won’t support that asking price, and you wouldn’t want to waste the seller’s time pretending that it does.


It seems like you are committed to listing your home at $X or above. You’ve probably spoken to an agent who feels confident they can get you that price. Unfortunately, I see the market differently. You deserve to work with someone who believes in your price.


If the seller wants to go with someone else, that’s okay! It’s their prerogative. Send them away in a limo anyway with this offer: If for any reason things don’t work out, and you feel I can help you, please feel free to reach out and contact me.


You made them feel understood, allowed them to make an empowered decision, and ended on a positive note. When their listing expires with that other agent, they’ll be back.

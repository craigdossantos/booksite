“Real estate agents are the greatest bargain on planet earth.”—Chris VossWe would like to dedicate this book to every real estate professional who truly wants to excel in this business. Every day, you go out into the world, working hard to be trustworthy, competent, and a straight shooter, with little or no appreciation. Most of your clients undervalue your service and think they can do your job better than you. It is virtually impossible for any buyer or seller to fully understand the complexity of your efforts and the skill and knowledge required. If they only walked one day in your shoes, perhaps they would have a very different opinion. Hopefully this book will give you the insight and wisdom to conduct your business to the best of your ability, and live with less stress and greater ease in everything you do.—Steve Shull

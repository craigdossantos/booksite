##### Chapter 5.  Put the Responsibility Where It Belongs


Own your role as the trusted advisor. It’s not your job to decide anything—only your client can do that.


One of my coaching clients, Victoria*, had a friend, Jasmine*11, who wanted to help her purchase a multimillion-dollar home. Jasmine wanted to work with someone she trusted, so she reached out to Victoria, who was thrilled at the prospect of working with her friend. While Jasmine’s expectations seemed a little unrealistic, Victoria agreed to help her because she didn’t want to disappoint her friend. You’ve all been in a similar situation.


Unfortunately, Victoria’s instincts were right. After several months of looking and writing offers and missing out on properties, both Victoria and Jasmine were feeling exhausted and frustrated, and there was some unspoken tension building between them. Victoria was disheartened because she felt like she was letting Jasmine down. In her mind she was responsible for getting Jasmine into a new home, and she was failing. This client relationship, which she had thought would be fun and easy, had actually created a massive amount of unnecessary work and anxiety in Victoria’s life.


Don’t blame the client, though. The agent is the one at fault here, but not for failing to get her friend into a new home. Her problem was strictly in her own head.


She was taking on responsibility for things that were outside her control.


She didn’t control what her friend was willing to offer for a new home. The only thing under her control was making sure Jasmine saw the best properties and knew what it would take to complete a successful purchase, including price, terms, contingencies, timing, etc. She had no ability to make Jasmine pay more than what she wanted.


Victoria was putting herself through the emotional grinder day after day for something that wasn’t her responsibility at all. Real estate agents do this to themselves all the time, and not just when the client is a friend. You think you should control every aspect of the process, so when something goes wrong, you think you’re at fault—or if not at fault, at least responsible for solving the problem.


Here’s the hard truth: you have no decision power in this process.


Your role is to be an advisor. It’s not your job to decide anything—only your client can do that. All you can do is lay out the landscape and present their options. You can make recommendations, but you can’t make them do anything. If you’ve built enough trust in your relationship, you can influence them (as you learned in Chapter 3), but you can’t force their hand.


Most agents don’t understand this, so they make themselves crazy and end up taking the blame for everything that doesn’t go their way. Stop it. It’s worse than unnecessary. It’s burning you out, wrecking your client relationships, and getting in the way of actually solving problems. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve listened to agents torturing themselves and beating themselves up for things that were never in their control. It’s a very bad habit that agents need to address if they’re going to have any level of sanity in their lives.


In this chapter, you’ll learn to own your role as the trusted advisor. Once again, it comes down to detaching yourself from the outcome—leaving your feelings, desires, and need for control behind so your client can make the decisions that are rightfully theirs. It will take a huge weight off your shoulders, moving you one step closer to feeling truly joyful and at peace in your work.


## The Old Way: Try to Solve Everything


If you’re like most agents, you never made a conscious decision to try to solve every problem and make every decision in the sales process. You just have this gut feeling that you need to. When a problem or choice comes up, your instinct is to tackle it, and you never think twice about whether it’s yours to tackle.


It feels like an instinct because it comes from a very old emotion: fear. You’re afraid of what the outcome of the process will be if you don’t dictate every move.


Agents get so attached to the outcome in part because they sell their services on the basis of promises about that outcome. When you overpromise to win a client, then you feel responsible for fulfilling the promise. At a conscious level, you’re afraid that if you don’t, they’ll walk away, or if they stick it out, they’ll be unhappy with the result and bad-mouth you. Unconsciously, your brain is taking that train of thought to its “logical” conclusion: if you lose your clients, your business will fail, you’ll go broke, end up on the streets, and die.


Thus, the fear…but none of that is real.


We’ve been through this before—you won’t die. On the contrary, if you stop grasping for control and detach yourself from the outcome, you’ll actually get out of your own way, just as you did in Chapter 3.


Think of all the things you take responsibility for that you have no real control over. If you’re like the agents we coach, the list is long: pricing, staging, when to list, when to hold open houses, choosing a buyer, making offers and counteroffers, accepting or rejecting offers, handling inspection issues…and all the other miscellaneous problems that pop up in every deal.


You don’t have the final say in any of this, but you try to convince, or even make decisions for, your clients anyway. After all, they hired you for your expertise, so you know what’s best. They’ll appreciate you taking the lead as the expert, right?


Not so much. In fact, not at all. Not even a little bit.


Never forget: people will die over their autonomy (see Chapter 1). When you take decisions away from them, or push them to choose, they resent you for it. You know this—just think about the last time you felt pressured to make a choice. Did you like that? Of course not. Neither do your clients, or anyone else.


Plus, taking responsibility for everything makes your life miserable. Anxiety and guilt pile up when things don’t go perfectly, which is usually. You blame yourself, and the client does too, because when you took on responsibility, they gave it up. Everyone ends up in a negative emotional state, and the relationship starts to unravel.


## The New Way: Advise and Guide


Let’s go back one more time to how you and your clients start out on opposite sides of the street. Instead of yelling at them to come over to your side, first you need to cross to their side and stand shoulder to shoulder with them. Then, you have to look at the view from their perspective and see where they wanted to go.


Now comes the next step: gently guiding them to their destination.


Taking responsibility that isn’t yours is like grabbing them by the wrist and dragging them up the road. Even if you’re taking them where they want to go, they don’t want to go like that.


Instead, just point out the possible paths, let them choose, and walk by their side to be there when they need more guidance. That’s the only way to preserve their autonomy, which is a crucial element in building trust, cultivating influence, and making the experience positive for them regardless of where they end up. If they feel in control, they’re more likely to feel satisfied with the final outcome, and even if they don’t, they won’t blame you.


You are not responsible for the outcome—you are accountable for doing what you say you are going to do. Your job is to lay out the landscape as best as possible. The client has to choose what direction they want to go.


#### Two-millimeter Shift: Responsibility → Accountability


You are not responsible for the outcome—you are accountable for doing what you say you are going to do. Your only job is to give your client the information they need to make their own decisions with confidence.


Remember, the only things you really have control over are how you market the listing (on the sell side) or how you search for listings (on the buy side), and how you conduct yourself with other agents. Everything else is beyond your power. It’s all up to the client, and you can only educate and guide them.


## It Matters Who Says It


Let’s say you have a client who insisted on an inflated asking price and, as a result, hasn’t received any offers. I bet this has happened to you before, so if you can recall a specific instance with a real client, think about that situation for a moment. Remember how you felt and how they felt after months of crickets from the market.


Now, imagine this: you say to your client, “We need to cut the price by 10 percent.”


How do you feel as you’re saying it? Probably some combination of anxious, frustrated, apologetic, and exhausted. You need them to agree, or the listing will expire without selling, and all this work will have been for nothing.


How does the client feel? Not too jazzed either, I’m sure. You said before that the house could sell at this price, and they had their heart set on it. Now, all they see is a 10percent loss, and it was your idea, so it’s on you.


Okay, now back up. What if, instead, your client said to you, “We need to cut the price by 10 percent.”


That’s a totally different ballgame. Instead of being at loggerheads, suddenly you’re collaborating. They might not be thrilled to cut the price, but they’re doing it willingly to get what they really want: a sold house. They understand that trade-off and have chosen to make it of their own free well, without pressure or coercion. You, needless to say, are massively relieved and happy to help them execute the decision they’ve made.


It’s the same idea as the first scenario, even the exact same words, but it came out of your client’s mouth instead of yours. That’s what we mean when we say it matters who says it.


When it comes to guiding and influencing your clients, think about it this way: whatever you want them to do, they need to think it’s their idea. At the very least, they need to feel it was 100 percent their choice to pursue that idea.


#### Two-millimeter Shift: Leading → Guiding


Taking the lead in the decision making process violates your client’s autonomy. Instead, provide the information they need to navigate the decision while letting them stay in the driver’s seat.


How would Victoria get Jasmine to say they need to cut the price by 10 percent? By playing the role of the trusted advisor. Remember, advisors don’t make decisions, and they don’t tell their clients what they need to do. They don’t need to do anything, and you can’t make them. All the advisor does is lay out the options and the likely consequences of each one.


So, she might say something like this, in her most deferential and respectful tone of voice: “With the house priced at $5 million, we haven’t received any offers in over two months. If you keep that asking price, the house could remain unsold for six months or more. If you reduce the price to $4.5 million, we’re likely to find a buyer within a couple of weeks, possibly multiple buyers. How would you like to proceed?”


First, she stated the facts of the situation. Then, she laid out the alternatives, stating them clearly as the client’s choices. Obviously, Victoria favors one option over the other, but instead of saying so, she just emphasized the loss the client would experience if she didn’t choose that option: the house would remain unsold. (That’s bending reality, from Chapter 3.)


Finally, she put the ball squarely in Jasmine’s court by asking her to own the choice. Not pressuring her to choose or suggesting which choice would be best—just giving her the space to consider the options, with her autonomy fully intact.


## Nothing Is Personal


One of the greatest dangers of taking on responsibilities that aren’t yours is that you’ll feel that you can’t bring up a problem until you have a solution. Agents feel that if they’re delivering bad news, they have to fix it—they can’t just let the client sit with it and make the decisions about how to deal with it. So, they don’t get the elephants out early like they should.


When you do this, your mind isn’t on the client’s needs—it’s on you. More specifically, it’s on your fear of how the client will respond to you. Because you don’t want the client mad at you, you don’t share what the client needs to know to make an intelligent decision. You put them at a disadvantage to protect your own ego.


But it’s not about you. Nothing in this business is ever about you.


I said it in Chapter 3, and again in Chapter 4, and I’ll say it one more time now: your emotions and desires have no place here. (Spoiler alert: I’ll probably say it again before the book is done.)


How you feel is irrelevant, but for so many agents, that dictates how they behave. Plus, when your vision is clouded by your emotions, you can’t read your clients, and you certainly can’t make them feel understood. How can they feel understood when all your attention is on you?


When an issue comes up and you start to have feelings about it—whether that’s anxiety, frustration, anger, hope, or anything else—the first step is to recognize that you’re having thoughts and emotions about this. Label them, just like you do when you’re preparing an Accusations Audit. Then, acknowledge what’s driving them: your fear of what will happen if you don’t control the process.


Remind yourself that you are not in control. You cannot decide, only advise. You’re not here to steer the process, only to find out where it will go. When you detach from the outcome, you can finally become the trusted advisor your client wants and needs.


Your feelings hold you back from that, so just let them go. Breathe, meditate, calm yourself down in whatever way works for you. I promise it gets easier with practice.


## Empathy, Not Sympathy


Like any new, learned behavior, it’s normal to struggle with it or feel some resistance. One common source of resistance is the cultural idea that you help someone else by feeling their pain. Emotions are contagious—that’s just human nature. When we see people smiling, we smile. When we see people get upset, we get upset. Just put a few babies together and wait: when one of them cries, the others start crying too.


But there’s a reason we call it Tactical Empathy and not tactical sympathy. Are the other crying babies helping the first baby by sharing its emotional experience? Nope. That’s sympathy, and it’s natural, but not very useful in this situation. You feeling upset on your client’s behalf is equally ineffective.


Tactical Empathy is the art of articulating what someone else is thinking and feeling, without necessarily agreeing or feeling the same way. That not only makes them feel understood, but it also prevents a disastrous feedback cycle of negative emotions between the two of you. Not only do you not need to feel bad about their problem (and remember, it is their problem), but you can be much more helpful if you don’t.


If you stay calm and detached from the outcome, you can just lay out the facts and the options, then let them sit with the information until they’re ready to make a decision.


I’ll end this chapter with a real life example of an agent who had to put the responsibility where it belonged in a big way to move forward with a client. The agent had been working with the seller for four months already, preparing the house for sale. The price was originally going to be $3.95 million, which made sense for the market at that time. The agent wanted the seller to do $30,000 of work to get the house market ready, and the seller was reluctant but agreed.


Then, three weeks before going on the market, the agent spoke to a trusted colleague who worked in the area, and his fellow agent thought the price was closer to $3.5 million. All of a sudden, panic took over. What if the price really is $3.5 million? What if I just had my seller spend $30,000 on staging that they wouldn’t have spent if they knew the price was only $3.5 million? How am I going to explain this? What are they going to think of me? What if I don’t tell them? What if I just wait to see how the market responds to the higher price?


The agent did not want to have this conversation with the seller. He worried and berated himself for days, imagining what the client would say and trying to find a solution before he had to break the news. The emotional agony made those days miserable, even when he wasn’t actively working at all.


But look at what he was taking responsibility for: the movements of the market and the seller’s asking price. He didn’t control either of those things, and he couldn’t solve this problem. He could only educate the seller about the new reality, and allow him to decide how to proceed.


The agent didn’t need a solution, and he didn’t need all that angst either. All he needed was to detach from the outcome, put the responsibility where it belonged, and get the elephants out early (complete with an Accusations Audit).


In the end, the agent figured out that $3.95 million was actually the right price. The property was listed at that price and sold quickly at full asking. All of this back and forth and mental anguish was totally unnecessary. Even if the price had needed to be lowered to $3.5 million, it was always going to be the seller’s decision. What the client needed was simply a clear picture of the options, and the autonomy to make the choice that was best for him. Would he have been happy if he had to lower the price by $500,000? Of course not. But instead of feeling blindsided by the situation and manipulated into a decision, he would have appreciated the agent’s transparency and professionalism. That’s the power of being a trusted advisor.

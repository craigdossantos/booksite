Your only real value is the trust you build with a client.


If you had HBO in the early 2000s, you might have watched a show called Entourage, which revolved around an up-and-coming actor, Vincent Chase (played by Adrian Grenier), and his troublemaking friends.


Early in the series, Vincent goes looking for an agent to represent him in Hollywood. When he sits down in the first presentation, the agent shows a video that flashes one massive brand name after another: “Mercedes…Coca Cola…Vincent Chase. We intend to make you as popular as both of them.” He’s impressed.


At the next agency, he sits down, and it’s the same thing. “Apple…Cannon…Vincent Chase.” Vinny raises his eyebrows at his friend, clearly thinking, This is the same thing we just sat through.


At the third agency, it’s the same spiel again: “Microsoft…McDonald’s…Vincent Chase…brand name recognition. What do you think?” This time, Vinny just walks out.


This is exactly what happens in the real estate industry.


Agents obsess over their listing presentations. They think that’s how they win clients, so they pour effort into making their presentation marginally better than the next agent’s. If you’re focused on convincing prospects to choose you with facts, logic, and reason, the only way to differentiate yourself is to pack in more information and insight than anyone else. You give your time and value for free, hoping it will make you attractive enough for them to decide to pay you.


Agents call this a best practice, but they’re kidding themselves. It’s only a common practice masquerading as something more. Just because everyone else is jumping off a cliff doesn’t make it a good idea.


You already know the logistical problems with this strategy. It takes hours, sometimes days, to do all the work involved in preparing, delivering, and following up on a listing presentation. If you don’t get the job, that’s a lot of wasted time. Plus, it’s all too easy for the prospect to simply hand your playbook to the agent they wanted to work with in the first place. Your so-called competitive advantage is impossible to protect when you give it away like that.


And even with all that work, how is your listing presentation really any different from those of your top competitors? Are there any big secrets to the process of selling a home? I’ve sat in on hundreds of listing presentations, and while the style can vary, the substance rarely does. Real estate isn’t rocket science. You can’t set yourself apart with your pricing or staging or marketing tactics because everyone with a lick of sense will do it pretty much the same way.


The truth is, there’s only one way to create a competitive advantage that’s effective and lasting, and it has nothing to do with your value. None of the things you can put down on paper as reasons you’re better than the next agent play into this. It’s not about what you do but how you do it.


The only real way to differentiate yourself is with trust.


Trust is what makes a person choose you. It’s what opens their mind to your influence, and it’s what allows them to handle the bumps in the road without blaming you for every pothole. It’s what leads to deals that feel good, even when they’re not exactly what the client imagined at the beginning of the process. It’s what makes them come back to you in the future, and refer other people to you. It’s the foundation of a real estate business that’s not just successful—it’s sustainable.


In this chapter, you’ll learn why trust is so much more powerful than value, and how to start building it from the very first moment you meet a prospect. It will go against every instinct you have as a salesperson…but with every instinct you have as a human being.


## The Old Way: Explain Your Value


Every salesperson gets trained to define the value of their products and services for their customers. It makes perfect sense—before someone will give you money for something, they need to understand how it will benefit them.


You know it’s true because you shop that way. When you’re comparing yogurt brands in the grocery store, or deciding whether to shell out thousands for an elite professional development course, you look for those indications of value. Which one is better? Is it worth the money?


So, when you’re selling your services, you try to communicate what makes you better than the others and worth the money. You talk about your track record, your market insight, your pricing strategy, your resources, your connections, your time commitment, and of course, your discounted fee. Maybe you deeply believe these things bring better results to your clients than what other agents can offer.


You say all this imagining the prospect will do some kind of mental math to figure out which agent will get them the best results. That’s what a logical, reasonable person would do, right?


There’s just one problem. To do that, they would have to take everything you say on faith. Even if what you claim is objectively true in your mind, your prospects can’t possibly have the knowledge or experience to verify that. And, just because you sell a ton of homes doesn’t mean working with you will be a good experience for them. Bottom line, they have no idea if you’ll actually do the things you promise, or if they’ll work.


There’s simply no way to know in advance which agent will get them the best results. Choosing a real estate agent isn’t like buying a laptop. With a laptop, you can look at the specs and try the machines for a few minutes to get a very accurate idea of which one will work best for you.


Not so with a real estate agent—you’re, as the economists put it, an experiential product. It’s impossible to know the benefits of working with you without actually working with you. Not only can prospects not know ahead of time which agent will be best, but they will never know for sure which would have been best, not even after the deal is done. They can’t go back in time and see what would have happened if they had sold the same house under the same conditions with a different agent.


So, based on your value, you’re indistinguishable from other agents—you’re a commodity. And you know what commodities compete on? Price.


Of all the factors that make up your value as you’ve presented it to your prospects, the only one they can understand and verify is your fee. So, that ends up being what they focus on, even if you know it’s not the biggest factor in how much money they’ll take home when the deal is done. Competing on price isn’t a sustainable way to run your business because there’s always someone out there who will work for less or promise more.


Most agents I meet are stuck deep in this way of doing business, commoditizing themselves by focusing on articulating their value in the listing presentation. Occasionally, though, I’ll find someone who relies on the force of their personality rather than the content of the listing presentation to win clients. They think that what truly sets them apart from other agents is them—their personality and how they interact with their clients.


That’s getting closer to the truth.


## The New Way: Build Trust


You can’t overcome emotion with fact, logic, and reason.


Remember that, from the very beginning of this book? People make decisions based on emotions. Fact, logic, and reason are how they justify the decision after the fact. When it’s impossible for a prospect to know your objective value, all they have left to go on is how they feel about you.


Don’t forget, they’re putting the biggest financial transaction of their lives in your hands. So, when I say “how they feel,” it’s not about whether they’d want to have a drink with you or be your friend. It’s about whether they believe in your competence, honesty, and reliability. They want to know if they can trust you to make this a good experience for them.


Your only real value is the trust you build with a client.


Buying or selling a home is a stressful, emotional transaction, and there will be bumps in the road. Your clients will forgive you for those and let you guide them only if they trust you to protect their interests.


When they do, every aspect of the relationship works better. You can be more transparent with each other, collaborate more effectively, and get things done faster. They’ll worry and nag you less, and you’ll bring a more positive attitude to every interaction. The process won’t be miraculously problem free, but each problem will feel more solvable and less stressful for both you and your client.


When you do a listing presentation the usual way, it does nothing to build that trust. You’re just explaining about yourself and what you plan to do, not getting to know the other person and making them feel understood. Not building a relationship.


#### Two-millimeter Shift: Value → Trust


When you sell your value, you become a commodity engaged in transactions. When you cultivate trust, you build relationships that lead to successful deals, repeat business, and referrals.


Let’s be clear: I’m not talking about cultivating trust as a tactic to win over prospects. Remember from the last chapter, there’s no winning anyone over. By the time they call you, you’re already the Favorite or the Fool. Their mind is made up. This chapter is not—I repeat, not—about swapping building trust for explaining value as a method of convincing someone to choose you.


It’s about no longer trying to convince anyone at all.


If you’re the Favorite, focusing on trust from the get-go starts the relationship off on the right foot. If you’re the Fool, it leaves them with a positive feeling about you, so they’ll be inclined to speak highly of you, and even come back to you if things don’t work out with their Favorite. It cannot magically turn you from the Fool into the Favorite—nothing can, and the whole point of the concept is that you shouldn’t try.


That said, let’s talk about how to build trust.


## The Indirect Route Is Faster


Trust develops over time. You know this instinctively because you’ve built trust before. Look at all the people you trust in your life—did any of them gain that status instantaneously? Of course not. Trust builds incrementally over many conversations and shared experiences in which the other person repeatedly shows that they understand you, care about you, and will protect your interests.


That gradual process forces you to change your orientation as an agent. Instead of prioritizing short-term results, you have to focus on the long-term process. Instead of making yourself a commodity, you have to be a human being. Instead of convincing someone, you have to let them choose.


This is the indirect route.


It feels less efficient. It seems like it will take longer. But, it’s like taking the ring road around a city instead of plowing through downtown traffic—less direct but much more effective. When you take the time to build trust first, everything that follows will be better and easier.


The key to building trust is letting go of your feelings and desires.


Your anxiety about whether they like you…your frustration that they’re not listening to you…your hope for a smooth sale and a healthy commission…all that, and whatever other inner feelings and desires are yammering for your attention, has to go. Detach yourself from the outcome.


It’s hard at first. We’re all used to hearing and following that inner voice all day long. I want this. I don’t want that. I like this. I dislike that. I wish…I fear…I hope…blah, blah, blah.


That voice is the roadblock to trust, and it’s going to take some effort to learn to ignore it. Once you do, though, you’ll never want to go back. You’ll look back at your old, self-interested tactics, and they’ll feel so dirty.


#### Two-millimeter Shift: Controlling → Letting Go


Talking is for chasing and convincing. Listening is for building trust. The way you listen has much more impact than anything you say or do.


It took a painful loss and some massively high stakes for me to learn to detach myself from the outcome. I wasn’t drafted into the NFL—I was a free agent, and my only chance at getting signed was to go to training camp with the Miami Dolphins and hope I made the cut. They brought in ninety guys, and had to narrow the field to forty-five by the end of camp.


We practiced twice a day, and I was lucky if I’d get in four plays in an entire day. When the preseason games came, though, I got to play a lot, and I excelled. When the time came for the last cut, I did the math, and thought I had it made…but I was wrong. I was one of the very last cuts.


To get that close to my childhood dream and have it slip away was like having my heart ripped out and stomped on. I went back to my hotel room after being cut, closed the drapes, and sat in the dark having a pity party while I listened to the celebration of the guys who made the team. Pretty sad stuff.


Then, a miracle happened. The next day, I got a knock on my door. One of the forty-five final players was put on injured reserve, so a roster spot had opened up, and I was back on the team.


But in those twenty-four hours of misery, all my confidence and bravado had gone out the window. Now, I simply didn’t want to make a mistake and get cut again. I knew what it felt like to lose my dream, and I was not going to let it happen a second time.


So, for the first five games of the season, I was no longer playing with reckless abandon, as I had done in the preseason. Now I was playing it safe, not taking risks and not putting myself out there. I was too worried about being cut again.


Before the sixth game of the season, I got a real wake up call. We were playing the New York Jets that week, and as I walked out to practice, Coach Shula was right in front of me. He spun around, looked me square in the eye, and said, “Son, you are not doing what we put you on this team to do.” Then, he turned back and walked away.


The message was obvious: I was about to get cut again. In that moment, I made a life-changing choice. I stopped in my tracks, got very quiet, and decided I was going to give my best effort and let the outcome be whatever it was going to be.


If my best effort was good enough to keep my spot on the team, great. If not, that would be okay too. Either way, my intent and focus was crystal clear: give my best effort, and don’t be attached to the outcome. This moment has never left me, and this lesson has proven invaluable, as it will for you if you choose to learn from it.


Go out every day and give your best effort, and let the score take care of itself.


Most of us run around every day grasping for control over all the things we think are happening to us. News flash: life isn’t happening to you. It’s just happening. You’re not in control of what happens, only of how you experience it.


Agents tear themselves up all the time with the illusion that they have control. When they get the listing, they think they did something right, and when they don’t, they think they did something wrong.


What if you stop trying to force the outcome you want, and just see what happens? That’s where trust begins.


## If You’re Explaining, You’re Losing


Something incredible happens when you detach from the outcome, and ignore that voice in your head that’s constantly nattering about what you feel and desire: you make mental space for the other person, your client. You can finally focus your complete attention on them and listen, for real.


Most people—especially salespeople—are terrible listeners. You’re distracted by thoughts of the spat you had with your kid this morning, or the never-ending list of things you need to get done. If your mind is actually on the conversation at hand, it’s busy predicting what the other person will say next, or preparing your response. It’s focused on how you can steer the conversation toward the goal you have in mind. At the first opportunity, you jump in to finish their sentence for them, answer a question, or express your viewpoint.


There’s virtually no actual listening—as in, receiving and comprehending someone else’s speech—happening at all.


I used to be guilty of this too. I spent years developing scripts that were designed to lead a prospect or client neatly to the conclusion the agent wanted them to come to. Needless to say, the agent did most of the talking.


In fact, you were probably taught to believe that your value as an agent is in what you say: providing information, giving advice, and solving problems. So, you jump at the chance to speak because that’s how you help your clients.


Except it’s not.


On the contrary, it’s impossible for you to help them until they trust you, and you build trust by listening, not talking. I’m not talking about some kind of fake “active listening” where you tell yourself to make eye contact, nod along, and say “I hear you” before launching into your own monologue. I mean real listening, the kind that only happens when you let go of what you want and focus exclusively on the other person.


We call that proactive listening—focusing all your attention on the other person, with the goal of seeing the world through their eyes. It’s proactive in that you’re watching for signs of negative emotions, and listening for ways to articulate your understanding of how they see the world. When you listen like that, you may very well make eye contact and nod along, but it’s not about those outward signs—it’s about what’s going on in your mind. Who are you thinking about, you or them? Are you climbing aboard their train of thought, or stuck on your own? Are you seeking to make them understand, or make them feel understood?


#### Tool: Proactive listening


Focus all your attention on the other person, with the goal of seeing the world through their eyes and expressing that understanding.


The way you listen has much more impact on your prospects and clients than anything you say or do. Think about that for a moment. It goes against everything you think you know, doesn’t it? But when you start to truly listen well, you’ll see it’s true.


#### Two-millimeter Shift: Talking → Listening


Talking is for chasing and convincing. Listening is for building trust. The way you listen has much more impact than anything you say or do.


Listen…then process…then speak to confirm your understanding.


When you do speak, instead of responding with your views, use the Tactical Empathy tools you’ve already learned. Label, mirror, paraphrase—all these tools require you to listen first, and keep your attention on the other person. Mirror their words to see if they have more to say about an idea. Use a label to confirm your understanding and make them feel heard. Use a deliberate mislabel to get a clearer picture of what they’re really thinking and feeling.


Most importantly, if you hear yourself explaining, STOP.


As Ronald Reagan said, “If you’re explaining, you’re losing.”


How often in a sales situation do you feel the need to explain or defend yourself? Why?


Explaining is the opposite of listening. It’s a sign that you’re focused on you again, and you don’t build trust by focusing on yourself. It’s also what you do when you’re trying to convince someone of something, and remember, you’re here to find out what’s on their mind, not change it. They’re not open to your influence until they trust you—until you make them feel understood.


## Bend Their Reality


I know what you’re thinking…but what if you need to change their mind? What if they’re about to make a decision they’ll regret because they aren’t seeing something clearly?


First of all, tread carefully here. You are not the authority on what your client wants or what is good for them. They are. Your role is not to help them decide what they want—it’s only to provide enough information for them to do that themselves. Please take all your superhero capes and put them back in the closet where they belong. You don’t need to save anyone from themselves. That is not your job as a real estate professional.


Remember the analogy about standing on the opposite side of the road from your client? First, you have to cross to their side and stand shoulder to shoulder with them. Then, you look at what they’re seeing and where they want to go. Finally, you help them navigate the path to their destination.


In that process, there are moments when you, as an expert on the local neighborhood, will have information your client doesn’t. Maybe they want to go to the top of a mountain off in the distance, but have no idea of the danger, time, or cost involved. Or maybe they want to cross to the other side of a field, but they don’t know there’s a marsh in the middle, and it would be easier to go around the field instead of straight through.


Let’s stick with that analogy for a moment. Imagine your client wants to go to the top of a huge mountain off in the distance. They’re thinking of the stunning view they’ll have from up there, and if you suggest that it would be much easier and almost as good to climb a nearby hill instead, all they will see is the loss: a nice view instead of a magnificent one. Not an attractive proposition.


What they don’t know (and you do) is that to get up that mountain, they’ll have to cross a desert, then climb a rock face, then hike through knee-deep snow in gale-force winds. It will be dangerous, expensive, and take weeks. On the other hand, they can walk up that local hill in an afternoon.


You can’t change their mind—only they can. And because fear of loss is the primary motivator of human beings (see Chapter 1), they’ll do that if they perceive their previous choice as a greater loss than some other option. In this case, the client was focused on the loss of that magnificent view…but you can bring to their attention the loss of time and money and possibly life it would take to get it. Then, they can decide which loss is worse.


Chris calls this a focused comparison. You’re not changing the facts of reality. You’re just changing how the other person perceives them—bending their reality, if you will.


This happens all the time with home pricing. Sellers are notorious for having inflated views of the value of their homes, and they often have their hearts set on an asking price that will prevent the house from selling quickly. When you suggest they lower the price, all they perceive is the loss (of money they never had in the first place, but it doesn’t matter—it still feels like a loss). What they’re not thinking about is the loss of time when the house goes unsold for six months, or how much more they might have to reduce the price by that point.


#### Tool: Focused comparison


Framing the facts to focus the other person’s attention on the potential losses associated with each option they face. Comparing potential losses instead of gains often changes how they think about the decision.


You can’t change their mind. You can’t convince them to lower the price, and to try would only undermine their trust in you. The only thing you can do is bend their reality. Give them a full, accurate picture of the potential losses they face with each option…and let them choose.


For example, here are several different ways to phrase the situation.


On the one hand, you want to make sure you are not going to leave any money on the table. On the other hand, you want to make sure your home sells. What pricing strategy makes more sense to you: pricing the home so the buyer is looking at what they love about the home, or pricing it so the buyer is looking at what they don’t like?


Or:


You obviously want to sell your home for the most money possible. What do you think is the better pricing strategy: making the buyers reach for your price, or creating a bidding war where buyers are competing against each other for your home?


Or:


You have a number in your head that makes sense to you. Anything less would feel like a loss. The question is, what is the best way to get the result you want without jeopardizing the sale because you listed the home at a price that scared potential buyers away?


Or:


Here is what you are up against if you price your home at that number…As crazy as it sounds given this hot market, while it is almost impossible to price a home too low, it is still very possible to price a home too high. That doesn’t make much sense, does it? What concerns, if any, do you have about overpricing your home so that it sits and doesn’t sell…causing you to miss out on this market altogether?


Once again, it’s not about you. You’re here to find out what your client really wants, and help them get it. Your feelings and desires have no place in that process, and they’ll only get in your way.


## How You Do Business


At first glance, it’s hard to believe that letting go of your desires will help you achieve them. How on earth are you going to get more clients and more income if you stop trying to get them? It sounds crazy.


But here’s the reality I’ve seen over and over in this industry: when agents do things the typical way, more business brings more stress. More money and status, maybe, but also worse quality of life, and less time to enjoy that money.


There’s a reason agents have a terrible reputation. They allow themselves to be defined by their production level, so they turn into mercenaries chasing after blood money. They become addicted to more, which just creates higher expectations and more pressure in a never-ending, vicious cycle.


There’s a high cost to doing business that way. Just like in my first five games with the Miami Dolphins, constantly pushing for what you want actually gets in the way of doing what it takes to get it. By focusing on your goals, you push away the people who will help you achieve them: your clients.


So, forget about convincing anybody of your value, or of anything else, for that matter. The only thing you need to do is build a trusting relationship…and the only way to do that is to detach from the outcome. Let go of your feelings and desires. Focus on making them feel truly understood, and everything else will fall into place.


Your primary job as a real estate agent is to cultivate relationships on a daily basis.


I want to repeat this in capital letters: YOUR PRIMARY JOB AS A REAL ESTATE AGENT IS TO CULTIVATE RELATIONSHIPS!


The consequences of this decision will ripple through your entire business and life. It starts with the Favorite or the Fool—that concept alone saves you countless hours of pitching to people who were never going to hire you in the first place. Now, when you build trust with your clients, every conversation, every hurdle, every decision is easier to navigate. It takes less time, feels better, and occupies less of your mental space. Your clients see you as a trusted advisor, and are more likely to follow your guidance and bring you more business in the future.


Trust doesn’t just give you more time and money—it brings you joy and inner peace.


That’s what we mean when we say that how you do business is more important than how much business you do.


This is what happens when you do business as an authentic human being with other human beings. You’re not a commodity, and they’re not paychecks. We’re all here on earth to be of service to others, and you’re learning how to find the people who want your help…and help them.

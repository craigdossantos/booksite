##### Chapter 8.  Be a Full-Service, Full Fee Agent


At 6 percent, real estate agents are the biggest bargain on the planet.


When you get the listing interview phone call, in your head, you are a 6 percent agent.


In your car going to the appointment, your fee is now 5.5 percent, with you keeping 3 percent.


As you get out of your car to go to the front door, your fee is now 5 percent.


When they answer the door, you blurt out unprovoked, “My fee is 4.5 percent!”


Does this sound familiar in any way?


If you want to know what it means to be a full-service, full fee agent, look no further than Regina Vannicola.


She’s one of our coaching clients, and like every agent who works with us, she used to be in the habit of making herself into a doormat. She prided herself on doing whatever it took to get the listing and close the sale, and if that meant discounting her fee or caving to crazy client demands, she did it.


Virtually all agents do. It’s not that they like being doormats—no one does. They’re just afraid of what will happen if they don’t.


After learning what you’ve learned in this book, Regina decided to be brave and find out. When a developer called her about listing a unit he was converting from an apartment into a condo, she went to see the property with a new mindset: Not, What do I have to do to get this listing? But, Is this opportunity a good fit?


This developer was a mover and shaker who owned lots of income properties in the community. Obviously, he was an old hand at real estate deals, and because so many agents discount their fees, Regina had doubts about whether he’d be willing to pay her full fee.


So, instead of avoiding the issue, she got the elephants out early. After touring the property, she said, “I’ve got some things we need to talk about that could be deal breakers for you. This is going really well, but I might throw a wrench in the works with this information, so I’d like to put it on the table now. Would you be opposed?


“No, go ahead,” the developer said.


“Here’s my top ten list of reasons why you won’t want to work with me.”


“Ten?” he asked.


“Well, no, there are really only about four,” she said, and the developer laughed. She continued, “First and foremost, I’m a full-service, full fee agent. I charge 6 percent, keep 3.5 percent, and give 2.5 percent to the buyer’s agent. I’m going to encourage you to price the property so that it will sell quickly, and that might very well be a price that’s less than what you’d like to see. I’m going to encourage you to invest in preparing it for sale, and you’re going to need to stage it. The last thing is that I don’t work 24/7. You’ll never need me and not get me, but you won’t need me at 10 p.m., and my phone goes off at 6.”


The developer took a step back and said, “Wow, that’s a lot of conditions! We just met.”


Regina laughed and said, “I actually prefer to think of them as standards.”


He paused for a moment, then asked, “Why don’t you split the commission equally with the buyer’s agent?”


At that moment, she knew she was hired. He wasn’t balking at her standards, just asking a question about a detail that wasn’t an important factor in his decision. With that knowledge came an upwelling of self-worth, confidence, and power.13


Most agents cringe at the very thought of approaching a prospect with a list like that in the very first conversation (or any time, for that matter). But when Regina talks about doing it, she can’t stop smiling.


Laying out the potential deal breakers—especially the commission—up front has saved her massive amounts of time and frustration. It quickly weeds out the bad clients, and the people who were never going to hire her anyway. What she’s left with are clients who believe in her worth and are ready to work collaboratively.


Plus, she just doesn’t have to sell as many homes to hit her income goals. Do the math: if you charge 5 percent and keep half, you have to sell 40 percent more homes than if you charge 6 percent and keep 3.5 percent. How would your life be different if you had 40 percent more time for yourself, or 40 percent more income for the same amount of effort? A 1 percent difference might seem small, but don’t be fooled—it will transform your business and life.


In this chapter, we’ll tie together everything you’ve learned so far into the mother of all tough conversations: your standards…especially your commission.


You’ll see that standing firmly by your fee isn’t about being greedy. It’s about being the best agent you can be for your clients. That might sound crazy now, especially if you’re thinking there’s no way you can get away with charging 6 percent in your market. By the end of this chapter, you’ll see that it’s not just sensible—it’s imperative, for your sake and your clients’.


## The Old Way: Doormat Yourself


Commission is the one topic that scares agents more than anything else. Everyone has an opinion, but no one wants to talk about it with an open mind. There’s a select group of agents who charge a full fee on one side of the street, and then everyone else—a much bigger group—on the other side, with virtually no middle ground. There is an overwhelming belief that you cannot charge a full fee and thrive in this business. Everyone wants to pretend there is nothing they can do about it. It’s a losing battle, they tell themselves. What’s the point in hashing it out again?


And yet this is probably the most important conversation that needs to happen. Commission is where the rubber meets the road in real estate. Your ego, your value, your self-worth, your self-confidence, your pocketbook, your future—it’s all up for grabs in that one moment when a potential seller asks, “What is your fee?”


That’s all it takes to make a real estate agent squirm. I can get a discount from ninety-nine out of one hundred agents just by asking that one, simple question. The default response to even the slightest hint of pushback on your fee is to hand out a discount, even when the client hasn’t actually asked for one.


Why?


It all comes back to fear. Fear that you’re not really worth 6 percent after all. Fear of being an imposter. Fear of being rejected. Fear of what will happen if you lose this opportunity.


To that, we say stop it! Stop letting fear run your life, and stop giving your money away!


You work too hard and too long to just let people reach into your pocket as if they were entitled to do so. Every buyer and seller wants your money. Whether they ask up front or at the end of the transaction or somewhere in between, they’re going to ask. Count on it. They always have a “legitimate” reason to ask, and you always have a “legitimate” reason to give in.


But the truth is, no one ever needs your money—they just want it because they think they can get it. If someone needs your $500 or $1,000 or $10,000 or more to buy or sell a home, they shouldn’t be doing the deal.


If only agents were as protective with their commission as they are with their split with their brokerage. How do you feel when your sales manager calls you into their office and says they need to lower your split? Do you just roll over? Of course not! But when a buyer or seller does the same thing, suddenly you become shy and small and timid. It makes no sense.


Bottom line: you can and must charge 6 percent.


As Chris always says, at 6 percent, real estate agents are the biggest bargain on the planet. In any other industry, a finder’s fee is 10 percent.


I’ve coached enough agents that I know you can charge 6 percent in any market. It doesn’t matter if your competitors are charging less. It doesn’t matter if you’re a super high-end agent working with multimillion-dollar listings. Save your excuses—we’ll get to those in a minute. First, we need to fix a false assumption that’s holding you back.


## The New Way: Full Service, Full Fee


Imagine this for a moment: what if a prospect told you they didn’t care about your fee? What if price just wasn’t an important factor in deciding who to hire?


You would charge your full fee, of course. If you know without a doubt that they don’t care, why wouldn’t you?


Well, guess what? They actually don’t care. I know this sounds insane, but just bear with me for a minute.


In one study of B2B sales, researchers broke down the sales process into nine steps, from the initial search for potential solutions all the way to engaging with a sales rep from the chosen vendor to make the purchase. Customers get pricing information in step three, but they don’t reach out to vendors until step eight. In between, they’re busy evaluating all their options and consulting with other people about the decision. By the time they talk to vendors, their mind is already 70–100 percent made up.


You already know this—it was one of the first things you learned in this book. When a prospect calls you, you’re already the Favorite or the Fool.


Here’s the crazy part. Customers know a vendor’s price way back in step three. If they get all the way to step eight and contact that vendor, they’ve reconciled themselves to that price. Otherwise, they would have eliminated that option by then.


In fact, researchers asked what the most important factors were when evaluating vendors (step three) and making the final choice (step nine). At step three, price is the number one consideration. At step nine, it doesn’t even make the top five. What they really care about is whether the solution is the right fit.


Whether it’s B2B or B2C, humans are humans. If that’s how they make major business purchases, it’s how they make major personal purchases too, including hiring a real estate agent. They know long before they call you that 5 to 6 percent is the industry standard commission. By the time you talk to a prospect, price is not a major factor in their choice.


You already said it: if you knew a prospect didn’t care about price, you would charge your full fee.


So from now on, that’s what you’re going to do.


## Are You the Favorite?


Here’s the real secret to getting a full fee. It’s not about providing more value, being more persuasive, or changing anyone’s mind. (You know by now that none of that has any place in your business anymore.)


It’s a function of one thing only: are you the Favorite or the Fool?


If you’re the Favorite, they’ll pay your full fee. They might ask questions or push back a little, but they’ll pay it in the end.


If you’re the Fool, it doesn’t matter what your fee is—they’re most likely not going to hire you. If you chase every low-probability deal and keep handing out discounts, sure, you might convert some of those prospects. But at what cost?


Discounting is a hard habit to break. If you do it once, you’ll do it again, and it can become a crutch very easily. That has long-term ramifications for your business that most agents never consider.


Here’s an exercise that will make you sick to your stomach: go back to your first day in real estate and add up all the money you’ve given up by discounting or chipping in. Go on, do it. The total number will shock you.


You may think you never would have gotten some of that business if you hadn’t discounted. Maybe, but you have no idea how much more business you would have done without those discount clients getting in the way.


As you learned back in Chapter 2, having to convince someone to work with you is a bad sign for the relationship. Those are the worst clients—skeptical, untrusting, and demanding—and one bad client takes up the space of two good clients. In other words, one discount client takes up the space of two full fee clients. If you’ve been operating under the illusion that discounting is good for your business, it’s time to face reality.


Let’s go back to something else from the very beginning of the book: you can’t overcome emotion with fact, logic, and reason.


This statement is at the heart of every commission discussion. Sellers don’t want to feel foolish by paying more than necessary—feel being the operative word here. You’ve probably studied all kinds of commission dialogues that try to convince people with facts, logic, and reason that you’re worth what you charge…but you can’t overcome emotion with facts, logic, and reason. There’s no convincing anyone to feel less foolish.


People will pay you 6 percent because they feel they absolutely want to work with you. In every interaction, you’ve demonstrated qualities—like trustworthiness, competency, and transparency—that give that person confidence in your abilities. They know you’re going to do what you say, and put their interests first at all times. They don’t want to go through this process without you.


All because you made them feel understood.


Those are the clients you want. With them, you’re the Favorite. They will gladly pay your full fee, collaborate with you, be open to your influence, and appreciate your hard work.


To make room for them, you have to walk away from everyone else. Make 6 percent your standard, and stick to it fearlessly. You’re not afraid to have the commission conversation, and you’re not afraid to say “no thank you” to those who aren’t willing to pay 6 percent.


It’s that simple. I’ve studied this from every angle possible, and the ability to charge 6 percent is not a function of market conditions, geography, list price, experience, or production. It depends on just this: do you have walk away power?


If you’re not willing to walk away from anyone who won’t pay you your full fee, you won’t be successful charging 6 percent. End of story. Six percent needs to be a standard.


And as Clayton Christensen, a former Harvard Business School professor, said: it’s easier to do something 100 percent of the time than 98 percent of the time.


From now on, you charge everyone 6 percent, no matter the situation or circumstance. If a seller can’t accept your fee, that’s okay—you just walk away.


Seriously, no exceptions. Just imagine a handful of your best clients getting together by some chance. The conversation comes around to you and what you charge. How would that conversation go? Would you be getting irate phone calls because you were charging different amounts to different people? How would that affect their trust in you and willingness to refer business to you or hire you again in the future?


Making 6 percent your standard is better for your business in so many ways…and it’s also good for your clients. Charging a full fee forces you to become a better agent because to charge more, you have to provide exceptional value. To provide more value, you have to examine every aspect in your business: your mindset, strategy, prospecting, follow up, marketing, showing, negotiating, problem solving, and everything in between. Does it all align with a 6 percent fee?


In The Science Of Getting Rich by Wallace D. Wattles, the author says: “Give every person more in use value than you take from them in cash value. Then you are adding to the life of the world with every business transaction.”


Challenge yourself to live up to your 6 percent fee. The irony is, you’ll end up doing more business and making more money by becoming more conscious about the work you do, and the value people derive from it. At first, insisting on 6 percent sounds greedy and selfish, but the reality is the exact opposite: it keeps you on your toes, and inspires you to do your very best work at every opportunity.


## No More Excuses


I know all the reasons why you feel you must lower your fee. All of them.


No matter what your excuse (and it is an excuse), the underlying reason is fear. You think there is not enough business out there for you. If you don’t discount, you’ll lose to someone else who will, and something is better than nothing. Time after time, you convince yourself there is no other option other than to concede. It’s just the cost of doing business.


It’s all B.S. The pull in this industry to discount is so strong, and there is such a herd mentality when it comes to your fee. So, let’s address the most common excuses directly.


### Excuse #1: Discounting has always worked for me.


You’ve gotten this far, right? Why fix what’s not broken? You’ve been discounting practically since day one, and you’re convinced that it’s a key reason for your success so far.


Chris likes to compare this to teenage boys shaving. At some point, every boy hears that shaving makes your facial hair grow faster and thicker. This isn’t actually true, but they don’t know it. So, the second a hair appears, they whip out the razor and have at it. Sure enough, they start to see more and more facial hair.


But that hair growing had nothing to do with the shaving. It was going to grow anyway, razor or no razor.


You think discounting is the reason you’ve won business…but is it? How do you know? Even if your clients said they’d go with someone else unless you reduce your fee, how can you be sure they weren’t bluffing?


You can’t. You also can’t know what other business you might have won if you had let those discount clients walk.


You’ve already heard all the ways discounting is hurting your business without you even realizing it. So yeah, it’s broken, and yeah, you do need to fix it.


### Excuse #2: No one will go for that—all the other agents charge less.


Over and over, agents tell me: Six percent can’t be done. No one in this market is doing that.


The second part might be true, but that doesn’t make the first part true.


In Chris’s early days as an FBI hostage negotiator, no one ever asked the kidnappers to put the hostage on the phone. It couldn’t be done, they said. When asked, the kidnappers always refused. It made getting proof of life (evidence that the hostage was, in fact, alive and in custody) extremely difficult.


But what if they asked in a different way? “Can I speak to the hostage?” was a yes-oriented question, and it wasn’t working…but maybe a calibrated question would change the game. So, they tried it: “How do we know the hostage is alive?”


It worked. All it took was a little tweak in their approach, and something that couldn’t be done suddenly became an extremely effective standard protocol.


We hear this excuse from most agents, but top performers and luxury agents are the biggest offenders. They fool themselves into thinking it’s all about market share. More signs means more sales.


I don’t disagree that more signs means more sales, but I do disagree with giving your money away to get more signs. If you’re losing market share over commission, there’s something else at play that you don’t want to address. It’s just easier to lower your fee than to closely examine the value you provide.


Anyone can give their money away. There is no skill or special talent in lowering your fee from 6 percent to 5 percent or 4 percent or lower. It’s just the fear driven, lazy way to do business. But as Chris said in Never Split The Difference, “You’ve got to embrace the hard stuff. That’s where the great deals are. And that’s what great negotiators do.”


Luxury agents also rationalize that they can afford to reduce their fee when the list price is so high. But in what other industry do the top professionals work for less?


Flip that rationalization around: if anyone can afford to pay a full fee, it’s the high-end client. Those sellers have the money and are used to paying top dollar for what they really want. And when the list price is high, the value of a truly skilled agent is amplified. A great negotiator could mean a difference of hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars in the final sale price. If it takes a full fee agent to get that result, of course they’ll pay.


I’m not just making this up. Our coaching clients include plenty of top agents, and we’ve seen them get full fees even in the top echelons of this business, where everyone says it’s impossible. We just had one agent get 6 percent on a $10 million dollar listing. Another sold a $50 million dollar house last year at 7 percent. It’s not impossible. It’s just a question of whether you’re the Favorite or the Fool, and whether you’re fearless enough to stick to your standards.


### Excuse #3: There’s a special reason for a discount in this case.


There are all kinds of reasons for giving a discount. The client is a friend or family member or a repeat client or a referral or my kid’s teacher or my spouse’s boss’s brother-in-law.


Here’s my favorite: If I represent both sides of the deal, I’ll charge 4 percent.


Whose idea was this? Somehow, this has become a standard practice in the industry, but how does this make sense in any way? When you double end a deal, you still have two jobs to do, and two sets of clients. Where is the logic in reducing your fee by 33 percent?


This same agent, who listed the $50 million dollar property at 7 percent, recently double-ended an $8.6 million dollar deal at 6 percent. During the negotiation, the seller asked the agent to reduce his fee to 4 percent. He simply said, with total deference and respect, “No. We can keep marketing the home to find a buyer who will pay more.” The seller happily signed the deal. They just wanted to make sure they weren’t leaving any money on the table.


No matter the situation, no matter how you look at it, no matter your motivation, when you choose to discount your fee, you are choosing to work harder to make less.


If you’re going to make this decision, make it consciously. The fee you charge ripples out in so many different ways and on so many different levels. Remember, when a discount is the only way to win a client, they’re probably a bad client who’s going to take up the space of two good, full fee clients.


And while you might think this is an isolated incident, it’s not. When you discount this deal, you’re also likely to be discounting any future deals or referrals from this client. Plus, you make it easier to justify discounting in other situations. Is that the way you want to run your business?


Like I said before, it’s easier to do something 100 percent of the time than 98 percent of the time. Six percent, no exceptions.


## Commission Conversations with Tactical Empathy®


Over many years, I developed what I thought was the perfect commission conversation script. With flawless facts, logic, and reason, it led the prospect to the inevitable conclusion that it would be worth paying 6 percent to get the best possible results. It worked pretty well—better than anything else I’d ever seen.


I threw it in the trash when I met Chris, and have never gone back.


The conversation you need to have is not about facts, logic, and reason. It’s about making the other person feel understood. When you apply Tactical Empathy to the commission dialogue, everything changes.


Imagine approaching that conversation with no fear. You’re not here to convince anyone. They either want you in their corner or they don’t, and you’re here to find out.


So, you cross the street and look at the world from their perspective. You reach into their head, read their mind and heart, and get into alignment.


Then, you put the subject out on the table without hesitation. You demonstrate absolute confidence in your very presence. You’re not afraid, and they know you will walk. They understand your fee is your fee, and if they want to work with you, that’s the number.


Imagine showing up this way every time.


How empowering would that feel? How energizing would that be? What would that inspire inside of you?


How excited would you be to work with people who valued you, respected you, and above all, trusted you?


That’s exactly where you’ll end up if you apply everything you’re learning in this book.


In your mind, this is probably a very big mountain to climb, if not an impossible one. Every part of your ego construct and all of your survival instincts are going to push back hard on this thought. Probably every word in this chapter feels like a suicide mission…but every great experience you have in life is found on the other side of your fears.


Let’s break down exactly how to get there. The conversation is always situational, so when you use this framework, always remember to listen closely to the other person, and respond to what’s happening in front of you.


### 1. Prepare your mindset.


Just as with every tough conversation we’ve talked about in this book, you need to approach it from a place of courage, curiosity, and confidence. Before you enter this situation, take the time to write out what the other person is probably thinking and feeling. Acknowledge your own thoughts and feelings, then let them go. Prepare to focus your full attention on the other person, with the simple goal of discovering what’s on their mind.


### 2. Bring up the issue gently but directly.


For most people, any conversation about money is an awkward one. When you bring it up, use your skills from Chapter 4 to soften the blow.


At the beginning of the chapter, Regina did this beautifully when she said, “I’ve got some things we need to talk about that could be deal breakers for you. This is going really well, but I might throw a wrench in the works with this information, so I’d like to put it on the table now. Would you be opposed?”


You don’t have to use her words, but you do want to warn the other person that you’re about to say something they might not like. Get their permission first.


There are some reasons why you might not want to work with me. I’d like to tell you about them now in case they’re deal breakers for you. Would you be opposed?


Then, say it directly.


I’m a full-service, full fee agent. I charge 6 percent, keep 3.5 percent, and give 2.5 percent to the buyer’s agent.


### 3. Find out what they’re thinking and feeling, and make them feel understood.


You want to see through their point of view, and understand why they think that way. It doesn’t mean you agree, just that you understand where they’re coming from. Once they feel understood, every interaction will become more open and honest.


Start with some labels to find out what results they care about most. Here are some examples:


You’re probably hoping to get top dollar.


You don’t want to leave any money on the table.


You would like to pay as little in commission as possible.


Then, use a no-oriented question to establish what matters to them in an agent.


Would it be wrong to assume you want to work with someone who is trustworthy, competent, and a straight shooter? Did I miss anything important?


### 4. Use calibrated and no-oriented questions to make them think deeply about the role of your fee in their decision.


Most people instinctively want to pay less, but haven’t thought through the consequences of that choice. Use a few questions like these to help them engage in that thought process and articulate it to you.


How are you going to factor the commission into your decision-making process?


How are you going to factor the final sale price into your decision-making process?


Would it be crazy to think that at some level, there is a correlation between the fee an agent charges and the results they produce?


What are you willing to give up in return for a lower commission?


What would you need to hear to raise your level of comfort regarding my fee?


Would it be crazy to think that the skill an agent brings to the transaction is more important than the fee they charge?


Would it be crazy to think the fee an agent charges is a direct reflection of their ability to negotiate?


Would it be unreasonable to think that an agent who discounts their fee is giving you a real clue as to their ability to negotiate?


Would it be crazy to think that an agent’s ability to negotiate is going to directly impact the final sales price of your home?


Would you be surprised to know that the final sales price of your home can vary 1 to 10 percent or more, up or down, based on your agent’s ability to negotiate?


Would it be unreasonable to think the agent who produces a superior result is going to charge more?


Would it be wrong to think what you really want is to net more at the close of escrow?


What are the terms that would make you happy and allow us to go forward right now?


### 5. Share a story that will help them understand the choice they’re facing.


Instead of shoving your track record in their face as evidence of your value, ask permission to share a story that illustrates how an agent can affect the results that matter most to the other person.


This is your opportunity to bend their reality. Change the loss they’re focused on: not what am I paying but what could I lose if I choose the wrong agent? Are they willing to risk a $1 million difference in sale price over $20,000 in fees?


You’re not trying to convince them, just putting the story out there for them to interpret in their own way. To do that, use a question like this:


Would you be opposed to going through a couple of real life scenarios that illustrate how commission and the final sales price actually impact what you net at the close of escrow?


Are you opposed to hearing why the discount agents can charge so much less and still claim to provide the same results or better?


### 6. Summarize the choice they’re facing and put the ball in their court.


No convincing, no pressure, no fear. Just lay it out for them and let them decide.


What I share with every seller is that in the end, it comes down to who you want in your corner from start to finish. Who do you want guiding you, helping you navigate through the twists and turns of this process? Who do you want negotiating for you, fighting for every last dollar, making sure not to leave any money on the table? Most of all, who do you believe is going to put your interests first at all times, no matter what?


That’s the person you hire, regardless of their fee. Do I think I am that person? Yes, but I’m probably a little biased. What’s important is, do you think I am that person? If you do, let’s work together. If you don’t, let’s shake hands, wish each other the best, and go our separate ways.


How would you like to proceed?


When you follow this framework, you open the door completely to being the Favorite or the Fool. If you’re the Favorite, they’re going to hire you there right on the spot. If not, they’ll thank you and say they’ll get back to you.


### 7. Address any pushback with proof of life questions.


You might not get a definitive answer immediately. Prospects sometimes push back, even if they do intend to hire you. They might say things like:


Is your fee negotiable?


Other agents are willing to do it for less.


We are really tight on money. We need every penny.


We have done a lot of business with you in the past. Can you give us a break going forward?


I can refer you business. Can you lower your fee?


I thought the going rate was ________?


Wow, that’s a lot of money!!


If you sell the home to your own buyer, will you reduce your fee?


This is what we pay.


In the past, we have never paid more than ________ percent. And we have done a lot of business.


If we both buy and sell through you…will you give us a break on commission?


Do you offer a friends and family discount?


You are a small independent. Can’t you be flexible?


(Developers) If we give you the listing on the back end, will you work for less on the purchase?


Instead of giving in or explaining why you can’t, use a proof of life question to find out if they’re serious about working with you. For example:


Why would you do business with me?


Why would you pay me 6 percent?


Why would you pay me more?


With all the other agents who are willing to work for less, why would you pay my full fee?


It seems like you are not opposed to the idea of working together…we just have to come to terms regarding commission.


Are you opposed to the idea of working with me, even though my fee is higher?


It sounds like you are not convinced you need to hire me in order to sell your home for top dollar.


It sounds like you have another agent in mind who charges less.


It sounds like someone else may be a better choice for you.


Are you totally and completely against the idea of working with me because my fee is higher?


If they can articulate why they want to do business with you, you’re the Favorite, and they’ll agree to your fee. If not, you’re the Fool, and it’s time to send them away in a limo.


Occasionally, you might even get pushback after a client hires you. For example, one of our coaching clients recently double-ended a $70 million listing. After the deal was done, the seller came back and asked for a 1 percent reduction in fee.


The agent was stunned. She knew she had done a great job, and sold the house at top dollar.


She called the seller and said, “I’m really sorry. I must have done a horrible job for you.”


The seller replied, “No, you did an incredible job!”


So, the agent said, “Then I’m confused…it seems like I’m being punished.”


That was all it took to get the seller to backtrack and happily accept the full fee.


## The Fee or the Feeling


When it comes to commission, what is truly most important to a seller? Is it the fee you charge, or the feeling you give them in terms of how they are going to be taken care of in the transaction?


Once again, you must take your own feelings out of the equation. Most agents approach the commission discussion full of fear. If you do that, you’ll try to convince the seller that you’re the best person for the job, relying on facts, logic, and reason to persuade them of your value. You’ll believe you need to tell them all the wonderful things you’re going to do for them to justify why they should hire you.


This path leads you into the trap of making yourself a commodity. The more you share and explain, the less valuable you become in the eyes of the potential client you are speaking with. Remember: when you’re explaining, you’re losing.


Instead, your new approach is to turn the commission discussion into a conversation about trust. Rather than defending your fee, you’re focusing on who the seller really wants to represent them. We broke that process down into steps in the last section. Here’s how it sounds all together.


Seller: Why should I pay you more?


Agent: It’s probably confusing that different agents charge different fees.


Seller: Yes, it is confusing.


Agent: Would it be wrong to assume that what you really want is to make sure you’re not overpaying, and you’re not leaving any money on the table?


Seller: That’s right.


Agent: When it comes to selecting an agent to represent you in the sale of your home, I share this guidance with every potential seller…would you be opposed if I share it with you?


Seller: Please do.


Agent: When it comes to selecting your agent, choose the one who gives you the highest level of confidence in achieving the best outcome possible. Who you believe will best prepare and position you for success…Who you believe will best help you navigate through the selling process from start to finish…Who you believe will best protect your interests at all times. That is the person you want to hire, regardless of their fee.


Just like that, you’ve moved this dialogue from a number to a feeling.


If you’re the Favorite, the door is wide open for them to choose you in that moment. More than anything else, the commission discussion revolves around whether you’re the Favorite or the Fool…and that comes down to a feeling of trust.


### This Is Your Moment of Truth


As Steven Ross said, “Paying my full fee is the litmus test for having a great client.”


Your commission is the cornerstone of your business. When you set your standard at 6 percent and stick to it fearlessly, everything else you’ve learned in this book must follow. It’s impossible to uphold that standard successfully unless you practice everything else you’ve learned about Tactical Empathy. The 6 percent fee forces you to commit to that practice 100 percent.


You may have other standards you want to uphold in your business. For example, Regina always has her clients stage their homes and price to sell quickly. She also doesn’t work Saturdays or answer the phone after 6 p.m. That’s what it takes to run her business and life the way she wants, and it’s nonnegotiable.


But, she doesn’t have to have a tough conversation about each of those things. If she can get past the commission issue with a prospect, she knows they’ll accept those things. If she can’t, it doesn’t matter.


The same is true for you. Set standards for how you work so that your business actually serves you and creates the life you want. Lay them out up front, just as Regina did. Just like your commission, those are reasons someone might not want to work with you.


But by far, the commission is the most important of all the standards. If a prospect agrees to that, they’ll agree to it all.


That’s why this whole chapter has focused exclusively on this one issue. Becoming a full-service, full fee agent is the culmination of everything you’ve learned in this book. It requires you to make the switch from transactions to relationships, from explaining your value to building trust, and from convincing to making people feel understood.

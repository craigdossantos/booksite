##### Chapter 1.  Ignore Human Nature at Your Peril


Starting now, you’re on a mission of fearless discovery.


Where do you go when you’re highly educated, extremely accomplished, and interested in making a lot of money?


Sell residential real estate? Isn’t that why you bought this book? Please indulge me on a short journey…


The younger me’s thought? Wall Street or Silicon Valley, the American meccas of ambition and brainpower.


Why? Those are the homes of the most important investment banks and venture capital firms, which deliberately recruit the smartest of the smarty-pants from the world’s top universities. They need people who can do the sophisticated analyses required to make good investment decisions, and they pay top dollar for them. You would think that with all that talent at their disposal, fact, logic, and reason would rule the day in the investment world.


Fat chance. Just look at all the companies that have skyrocketed to massive valuations, only to collapse into nothing when the hype wears out.


Take Theranos, the company that promised to revolutionize blood testing and drug delivery. It took in over $700 million in capital and reached a valuation of $9 billion on promises alone, with no hard evidence that its core technology even worked. The investors who backed Theranos and the huge healthcare companies who partnered with it heard what they wanted to hear, and chose to believe it without fully verifying the facts.


Theranos wasn’t an isolated incident, although it’s certainly one of the most extreme. Emotion-driven booms and busts happened with WeWork, GameStop, SunEdison, Enron…the list is long. Investors heard and saw things that sounded so wonderful, they neglected to check their sources and crunch the numbers properly.


Here’s both the good news…and the bad news. Human beings are not purely rational creatures. Yes, we’re capable of logic, but our emotions and instincts are powerful enough to derail that analytical thinking, often without us even noticing. Over the past few decades, advances in neuroscience have allowed scientists to show just how active the emotional brain is during the decision process. The data on human behavior in real-life decision-making situations backs this up.


Fact, logic, and reason are just one part of how people do business, and the higher the pressure, the smaller that part often is. Make no mistake—real estate is high stakes. Buying or selling a house might be the biggest financial transaction a person ever makes, and it affects every aspect of their daily lives.


Your influence won’t stick until you make them feel understood. That concept is as sure as gravity. Chris and I (and the Black Swan Group), would call it a Law of Negotiation Gravity.


The first step toward your goal of having your influence stick is to learn what’s really going on inside their heads. Not the pro/con, profit/loss calculations but the emotions that so often override logical reasoning. When you understand and accept these realities of the human condition, your job (and your life) will get a lot easier.


Another of the Black Swan Group’s Laws of Negotiation Gravity: ”Ignore human nature at your peril.”


Chris and I believe so strongly in this, that in this book and for your challenges, we are going to give you the Seven Essential Truths of Human Behavior.


## Seven Essential Truths of Human Behavior 1


There are whole libraries of books on human behavior, if you want to see the evidence in nitty-gritty detail. That’s pretty time consuming, and you’re busy, so here’s a quick hit list of what you need to know, spelled out in plain English. Some of these statements may seem surprising or counterintuitive at first, but when you start applying them to what you see every day, you’ll realize how much they explain about why people do what they do.


### 1. The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior.


This clichéd phrase bothers some people because they think it implies that people can’t change, which isn’t true. It doesn’t—it just implies that it’s hard for people to change, which is absolutely true. We’re creatures of habit because doing things on autopilot makes it easier to function in a world with way more information and choices than even our advanced brains can handle.


There’s an important nuance here—the word “behavior.” We are not applying this truth to “words”, specifically “words” compared to “behavior.” There is an old saying, “Your actions shout so loudly in my ears I can’t hear what you are saying.”


This is one of the reasons why the “Yes Momentum” has been shown to be faulty.2


When was the last time you thought about the way you walk, talk, or think? How often do you buy the same things without even considering other options? How much of your day is taken up by routines of hygiene, exercise, food, work, and travel? It’s not a bad thing. We need to minimize the cognitive demands of everyday activities so we can free up brainpower for the tough stuff.


What this does mean that in most situations, people (including you) are most likely to do what they’ve done in the past under similar circumstances. This is especially true under pressure—when stress hijacks most of our gray matter, we default back to our habits. Yet even in low-stress situations, people tend to stick with what they know because it feels comfortable and safe.


Just recognizing this helps you predict how people will behave. If you can find out what they did the last time they sold their house or made some other major decision, you’ll have a big clue about what they’re likely to do this time around.


Don’t forget that this maxim applies to you too. This book is going to push you to break and rebuild your habits around selling real estate, and it’s going to be uncomfortable. But the more you practice new behaviors, the more they become the past behaviors that you default to. The first time is the hardest—it only gets easier after that.


### 2. There is no such thing as a fully open mind.


In studies of B2B buyer decision-making, researchers have found that when a buyer contacts a vendor, their mind is already made up about half the time.3 If it’s not, they’re more than halfway through the decision process.


The numbers are a bit shocking, but when you put yourself in the buyer’s shoes, it makes perfect sense. When you make a big purchase, you don’t just go straight for the salesperson. You gather information first. By the time you talk to a salesperson, you’ve learned enough about your options to have a pretty good idea of what you want. Your mind is no longer fully open.


Fair-minded people have a hard time embracing this. You don’t want to think of yourself or others as close-minded. When you’re the buyer, you tell yourself that every option is still in the running until you’ve made your final decision, even when you know deep down that you have a clear preference. You talk to other salespeople, thinking maybe they’ll say something to sway you, but in reality, the chances of that are minuscule.


When Chris needed to hire an HR consultancy to work with his company, his accountant suggested a firm to him. He interviewed that firm and liked them, but he still talked to others to see how they might be different. He knows quite well there’s no such thing as an open mind, but even he was kidding himself that he might choose someone other than his accountant’s referral. Then, in the middle of a sales conversation with another candidate, he asked himself what the chances were that he would actually give that person his business. Zilch: he was always going to go with the recommendation of a trusted ally.


In the next chapter, you’ll see how this changes everything about how you do business. It sounds like a negative thing at first—no one wants to believe they’re not really in the running. In reality, though, it’s the key to your freedom. If you can learn to tell when a buyer is truly considering you and when they’re not, you can stop wasting your time on false opportunities.


### 3. Humans are hardwired to be negative.


It’s right there in our brain structure. In our layman’s assessment of studies we have seen of fMRI activity of the human brain in response to negative emotions, 70 percent of the amygdala (the part of your brain that assigns emotional importance to sensory information) is dedicated to negative emotions.4


This is pure evolutionary biology. Responding appropriately to danger with negative emotions like fear or anger is a lot more crucial to survival than responding to positive stimuli. So, it makes sense that our brains err on the side of caution—that’s how you stay alive. Most of us don’t face life-and-death threats every day anymore, but evolution hasn’t caught up with modern civilization.


Most real estate agents are bogged down in negativity. They walk around waiting for the other shoe to drop, thinking about what bad thing is going to happen next: what tough conversation they’ll have to have, what mistake they’ve made, what will upset the client.


We can’t change our biology, but we can use simple tools to help mitigate that natural negativity. In those same fMRI studies, something fascinating happened. When the researchers asked the subjects to label their negative emotions, those emotions dissipated. They defused negativity just by labeling it. In later chapters, you’ll learn how to use this technique to make tough conversations with your clients a whole lot easier.


### 4. Fear of loss is the primary motivator of human beings.


Daniel Kahneman’s Prospect Theory, which won the 2002 Nobel Prize in Economics, says that the pain of a loss is twice as powerful as the pleasure of an equivalent gain.5 In other words, to make up for the pain of losing ten dollars, you would have to gain twenty. Financially, that puts you ten dollars ahead, but emotionally, you’re even.


That means the fear of loss is a much more potent motivator than the prospect of gain. So, why is every real estate agent pitching the prospect of gain? It’s a “best practice” that many people are reluctant to part with. Talking about future gain feels positive and safe; talking about potential loss feels negative and manipulative.


But in fact, the surest way to get someone to act is to make them perceive inaction as a loss. Self-help giant Tony Robbins understands this—that’s why he guides people to imagine their ideal future in vivid detail, to the point where they feel like it’s truly theirs. Then, if they don’t take the steps required to make it real, they’re losing that ideal future. Through visualization alone, the prospect of gain turns into the prospect of loss, and suddenly the need for action seems much stronger.


This is a crucial human foible to keep in mind when influencing clients and prospects. What seems like a complete unwillingness to follow your advice can change in an instant when you bring a compelling prospect of loss into view.


### 5. Compromise is never equal—it’s a downward spiral.


Everyone thinks compromise is the way to make a fair deal. You give a little, I give a little, and we come to a fair middle ground that everyone can accept, right? Even Shark Tank investor Kevin O’Leary says a good deal is one where both sides are slightly unhappy, meaning both have compromised a little.


Well, what if I can’t choose between black shoes and brown shoes? Should I compromise by wearing one of each? Of course not. That’s the worst possible outcome, and the same is true for real estate deals (or any negotiation).


This goes back to Prospect Theory again. Every time you give ten dollars, you won’t feel satisfied until you hit the other side for twenty, and they won’t feel satisfied until they hit you for forty, and on and on. It’s easy to see why both sides end up unhappy with a compromise.


Whether the deal looks good on paper or not is irrelevant. What matters is that your clients feel bad about it, and clients who feel bad don’t recommend you to others. Compromise is killing your referral rate…which kills your pipeline and your future.


### 6. People will die over their autonomy.


“Give me liberty or give me death.” It’s not just a slogan of the American Revolution—it’s the expression of a simple human truth. No society has ever been content in slavery.


S.W.A.T. teams learned this the hard way in their early days, when their hostage negotiation strategy was to shout, “Come out or we’ll kill you!” People are kings of their castles, and given that kind of ultimatum, they often value their autonomy over their lives. So, S.W.A.T. teams all over the country ended up shooting people who didn’t need to be shot.


Even when it’s not a life-or-death ultimatum, no one likes to be forced into a choice. That’s why persuading in the typical sense feels so uncomfortable. You feel pushy and they feel pushed, even if what you’re convincing them to do is truly in their best interest. That’s no way to build trust or rapport.


In later chapters, you’ll learn exactly how to influence people while allowing them to stay in the driver’s seat and own their choices. It doesn’t just make them happier—it will make you happier too because you won’t have to feel like a sleazy salesman, or take responsibility for choices that aren’t yours to make.


### 7. Vision drives decision.


Consciously or otherwise, everyone has visions in their mind of what they fear and want. In virtually every situation, we imagine how things will turn out before they actually happen, anchoring our expectations based on those personal (and often unspoken) desires and worries. That vision of the future determines how we act in the present.


Let’s say you’ve just been introduced to a new skill, something that’s way outside your comfort zone. It seems difficult, and you immediately imagine yourself failing at it. You haven’t even tried it yet, but your mind is already fixated on the possibility of frustration, humiliation, and disappointment. So, you decide to pass altogether.


How about a scenario we’re all familiar with: a seller who has a vision that their house will sell at their inflated target price. Even if you tell them the price is too high, they’re anchored on that expectation and won’t budge.


Before you can influence someone, you have to know what their vision is. Most agents focus on conveying and defending their own point of view, not realizing that their vision isn’t the one that matters. Your clients and prospects already have their own visions of what’s going to happen, and they don’t care what yours is. Your job is to see their vision, and gently nudge them to adjust it when it’s out of touch with reality.


## Tactical Empathy®: Your Swiss Army Knife


Real estate brings those seven essential truths out in everyone because it’s not just a transaction—it’s the American dream. Owning property is part of that glorious ideal of freedom and equality, which makes it extremely emotional. Even for seasoned home owners who have bought and sold before, the deal determines not just their next home but how the next phase of their lives will look. That’s heady stuff.


Every seller is hoping for more money, and every buyer is hoping for a bargain. To get as close as possible to those dreams, they’re going to need you, but they won’t accept your help until they know you get what they want. They want to feel seen, heard, and understood.


Thankfully, you don’t need a different tactic for each one of those seven truths. They all share one solution: Tactical Empathy. Think of Tactical Empathy as the Swiss Army knife for making people feel understood. It isn’t just one tool—it’s a collection of tools that work together to achieve one life-changing outcome.


To see what that outcome looks like, imagine you and a client are standing on opposite sides of the street. What most agents do is shout across the street for the other person to come over…which hardly ever works. And when they try to practice understanding or empathy, it just means using their knowledge of the client to hone their argument. They’re looking for the right things to say to convince the other person to cross.


That’s not Tactical Empathy. In this book, what you’re learning to do is cross the street, look at what they’re seeing, point out some things they might have missed, and then help them navigate to where they want to go.


Night and day, right?


Not only is it vastly more effective to do business this way, but it also feels good, thanks to the brain chemistry of trust. When people feel understood, they get a hit of oxytocin, the same hormone that bonds parents and children, romantic partners, and friends. Tactical Empathy helps you form a very real bond that will endure even through the inevitable frustrations and anxieties of getting to a deal.


## The Explorer Mindset


Starting now, you’re on a mission of fearless discovery.


There is nothing to be afraid of. None of what you’re going to do is about making stuff happen—it’s about embracing what’s happening. You don’t have to become a different person or put on a mask to be successful with this. All you have to do is set aside your desires, get curious about other people, and open yourself to being smarter today than you were yesterday.


We call this an experiment in surrendering6: an ongoing exercise in letting go of control and detaching yourself from the outcome of each conversation and deal.


Remember, you’re not making any irrevocable decisions by trying new things. Inevitably, there will be something in this book that will violate a principle you hold dear. It’s going to horrify you, and your amygdala will whisper in your ear about how it will go bad…but your amygdala is not your friend. Promise yourself now that no matter how scary it seems, you will at least try it.


You’re not burning any bridges. You can always go back to your old methods if it turns out as horribly as you imagined. In our experience though, it never does.


So, don’t defeat yourself before you begin. We’ve seen agents sit in their cars for an hour before knocking on the door, ruminating on everything that could go wrong. Why torture yourself like that? Just dive in and see what happens. It’s an experiment, and you’re a scientist, just observing the outcome and collecting data. No value judgment.


In those moments when it feels hard to just do it, it’s helpful to think about cows and buffalo in a storm. When cows feel a storm coming, they instinctively run from it. But the storm always catches up, and they end up running right along with it, prolonging the pain and frustration. That’s exactly what you’re doing to yourself when you procrastinate, hesitate, and avoid the inevitable.


Buffalo, on the other hand, run straight towards the storm. By facing it head-on instead of trying to avoid it, they minimize the time they spend in the wind and rain. The hard part is over faster because they charged right into it.


So, as you practice the techniques in this book, remember that trying to avoid the tough stuff only prolongs the pain. Be the buffalo. Run into the storm.


Of course, we can’t guarantee Tactical Empathy will work 100 percent of the time. Nothing does. However, Tactical Empathy will give you the best chance for success in any situation.


In Chris’s experience using Tactical Empathy in hostage negotiations, his teams had a 93 percent success rate. That meant 7 percent of hostage takers were going to get shot. So, they learned to look right away for signs that the other party wasn’t responding as expected.


You might find people like that, who have put up such a strong shield against empathy that they’re unreceptive to this method. When you do, walk away—you don’t want to work with those people. They’re rare, though. Most people crave empathy, and when you learn to practice it with authenticity and confidence, you’ll find that virtually everyone around you will light up in response—prospects, clients, colleagues, and even your friends and family.


That’s when you’ll realize this is more than a way of doing business. It’s a way of living. It’s a reawakening of who you really are as a human being.


It just happens to also help you build a stronger business. And now that you’ve seen the essential truths of how people behave, you can put that knowledge to work, starting with the very first conversation you have with a prospect.

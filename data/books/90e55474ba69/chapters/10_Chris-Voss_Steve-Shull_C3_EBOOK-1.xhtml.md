### Key Takeaways



- Explaining value is about fact, logic, and reason. Building trust is about emotion, connection, and relationships.
- The first one seems easier, but it doesn’t work because that’s not how people really make decisions. Plus, it turns you into a commodity, because there’s always someone who will promise more and charge less.
- When you take the time to build trust first, everything that follows will be better and easier.
- The key to building trust is letting go of your feelings and desires. That’s what allows you to focus your complete attention on them, and truly listen.
- You can’t convince anyone to do anything, and to try only undermines their trust in you. Instead, influence them by bending their reality, i.e., focusing their attention on potential losses they hadn’t previously considered. Then, preserve the trusting relationship by letting them make the decision.

## Tactical Empathy Toolbox



- Proactive Listening: Focus all your attention on the other person, with the goal of seeing the world through their eyes.
- Focused Comparison: Framing the facts to focus the other person’s attention on the potential losses associated with each option they face. Comparing potential losses instead of gains often changes how they think about the decision.

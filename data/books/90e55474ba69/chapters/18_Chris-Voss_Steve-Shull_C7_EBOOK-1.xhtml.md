### Key Takeaways



- The last impression is the lasting impression. If a deal closes in a way that doesn’t feel good to the client, that negative emotion is what they’ll remember.
- That’s a huge problem for your business. People who walk away unhappy won’t work with you again, or refer others to you.
- Follow the Oprah Rule: send everyone away in a limo. That means practicing Tactical Empathy in every relationship, all the way to the end.
- Splitting the difference and chipping in to make a deal come together are lazy tactics that undermine your relationship with the client. Don’t give into the temptation to use them—practice Tactical Empathy instead.
- All of this applies to every relationship, regardless of whether the person chooses to do business with you now. If you send them away in a limo, they’re more likely to come back again.

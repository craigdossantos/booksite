#### Elaine Stucy


December 12, 2000 was the evening my life changed forever. Desperately in need of improvement in my sales results, I contacted Steve Shull, a business coach I had heard on a conference call. He sounded strong, confident, even intimidating. It didn’t matter, I urgently needed direction. Did I say direction? Instead, I got an earthquake! Steve initiated a radical about-face in my career and life. In one remarkable—and very short—conversation, the man showed me the blue-sky potential of a career in real estate. I believed him. He changed my direction all right…and transformed my life.


After that conversation, I knew better than to expect anything conventional from Steve’s coaching. That was twenty-one years ago, and to this day, he can’t let it rest. Steve is still a man on a mission of discovery into how to help real estate brokers become the best of the best and enjoy the process.


In my early years, his coaching was all about discipline, focus, and goals. He relentlessly taught me how to create $1 million a year in revenue. Steve instilled belief—not blind faith, but credibility worth trusting. Whatever he told me to do, I jumped in with both feet, usually with great results. Over the years, I built a boutique brokerage and sold to a major brokerage firm, where I still practice.


When Chris came on board a few years ago, it took things to a whole new level. What we were doing had been working well, but Chris’s insight into human behavior was like rocket fuel. Steve went all in, so I did too, and the resulting transformation made my business more successful and sustainable than I ever imagined.


Above all, Steve has uncanny insight and perception. He is always learning, investigating, experimenting, and improving, and he sees to the heart of situations and people in startling ways.


A recurring lament from Steve is that no matter the level of success, or lack thereof, his clients share puzzling maladies. Why such constant stress and drama in agents’ lives? Why are agents always operating out of fear? How is it that many are afraid to take a day off (you know who you are), reluctant to tell clients when they are taking a vacation, making everything personal, striving constantly to be liked, cutting fees to get business, worried, attached to every outcome, determined to convince, or too superstitious or fearful to try something different? A small percentage transcend, but most suffer.


Steve always admonished us that there is no magic pill in real estate. On that prescription, he may be proving himself wrong. He and Chris are giving the real estate world a book with all the effects of a magic pill, a great elixir. Oh, it might be hard to swallow for some. It takes courage and spirit to let go of practices that don’t work well, to open up and absorb a new way. It takes even more courage and faith to suspend resistance, and believe there is an even better way when what you do is working. Within these pages is the extraordinary wisdom to create a bridge of trust between people, and make the process of a real estate career a wholly beneficial, joyful experience. I hope you have the courage to try.

      "title": "THE NEW RULES",
      "summary": "Chapter 1, \"The New Rules,\" introduces the author's background as an FBI hostage negotiator and contrasts his practical experience with the theoretical approaches to negotiation taught at Harvard. The chapter highlights the limitations of purely rational, problem-solving negotiation techniques when dealing with emotionally charged situations. It emphasizes the importance of understanding human psychology and using emotional intelligence, particularly tactical empathy, to influence outcomes. The author recounts his experiences at Harvard, both in an executive course and a law school negotiation class, to illustrate the effectiveness of the FBI's emotionally-driven approach compared to the more traditional, rational methods.",

          "title": "The Harvard Negotiation Exercise",
          "description": "The author is challenged by Harvard negotiation professors Robert Mnookin and Gabriella Blum in a mock hostage situation where they 'kidnap' his son. Mnookin demands $1 million. The author uses open-ended, calibrated questions like, 'How am I supposed to do that?' to deflect their demands and force them to address the logistical problems of getting the money. They get frustrated and end the exercise.",
          "lesson": "Open-ended questions can shift the frame of a negotiation, create the illusion of control for the other party, and buy you time while revealing their constraints. It also highlights the importance of not being easily bulldozed by demands."

    "context": "The author contrasts Harvard's theoretical approach with the FBI's practical success, implying a causal link between their techniques and positive outcomes. However, without concrete data, it's difficult to ascertain if this is truly the case or if other factors contributed to the successful resolutions.",

How can these techniques be adapted and effectively implemented in situations where there is a significant power imbalance or cultural differences between the negotiators, such as negotiating with a powerful corporation or in a cross-cultural business negotiation?",
    "context": "The chapter highlights the author's success in a specific environment (Harvard negotiation course). It is not clear how well the described techniques would translate to real-world scenarios where factors such as power dynamics, cultural context, and resource disparities could heavily influence the outcome.",

In scenarios with unequal power dynamics, such as negotiating with a large corporation or in situations of extreme poverty, the technique might be less effective or even exacerbate existing inequalities. It's necessary to explore adjustments or alternative strategies that address these real-world constraints.",

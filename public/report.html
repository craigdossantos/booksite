                <p>This chapter serves as an introduction, recounting the author's personal story of a life-altering baseball accident during his sophomore year of high school. He describes the immediate aftermath, his physical recovery, and the emotional and mental challenges he faced. The chapter then transitions into how this experience led him to discover the power of small habits and their impact on achieving goals. He highlights his college baseball career as a turning point, where focusing on consistent habits led to significant improvements. Finally, he discusses how he started writing about habits online, leading to a successful writing career, a book deal, and the creation of the Habits Academy. The chapter concludes by outlining the book's goal: to provide a step-by-step plan for building better habits for a lifetime, based on a four-step model and the four laws of behavior change, drawing from various fields of study.</p>
